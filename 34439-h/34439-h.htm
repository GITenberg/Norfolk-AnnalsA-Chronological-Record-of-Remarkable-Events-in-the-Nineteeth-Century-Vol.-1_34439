xi</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Norfolk and Norwich Remembrancer and Vade
Mecum,&rdquo; upon the plan of which this work is compiled, was
published in two editions.&nbsp; The first (undated) was issued
in or about 1801.&nbsp; It appeared in pamphlet form (f&rsquo;cap
8vo), and contained (1) a brief topographical description of the
city and county; (2) a &ldquo;Chronological Retrospect of the
most remarkable events which have occurred in Norfolk and Norwich
during the 18th century, with a list of Bishops, Deans, High
Sheriffs, Mayors and Sheriffs of Norwich, and Mayors of Yarmouth
and Lynn within that period&rdquo;; (3) an Index Villaris,
&ldquo;including an accurate account of the population, &amp;c.,
of every parish in the county, extracted from the official
returns taken in 1801, with the measured and computed distance of
each market town and village from the city of Norwich; also the
returns of the population of Norwich, as taken in 1693, 1752,
1786, and 1801&rdquo;; (4) a list of direct and cross roads from
Yarmouth, Lynn, and Cromer; and (5) an alphabetical list of
&ldquo;noblemen and gentlemen&rsquo;s seats and villas in the
county, with their distance from Norwich.&rdquo;&nbsp; The work
was printed and sold by Stevenson and Matchett, Market Place,
Norwich, and was &ldquo;to be had of the distributors of the
<span class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span> and of all
booksellers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Remembrancer&rdquo; consisted of 80 pages, and was
published at eighteenpence.&nbsp; Although the
&ldquo;Chronological Retrospect&rdquo; extended over the period
of one hundred years&mdash;from 1701 to 1800 inclusive, it was
compressed into 43 pages.&nbsp; This, the most important section
of the work, was reprinted from a local chronology published in
the <span class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span>, compiled partly
from old Norwich histories and partly from the early files of the
newspaper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Omissions or errors which may have
occurred in this work,&rdquo; says a footnote to the
&ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; to the first edition, &ldquo;shall be
corrected in a future edition, and notice of such will be
thankfully received by the Editors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>But many years elapsed before the publication of a
second edition, and it was not until 1822 that the
&ldquo;Remembrancer&rdquo; again made its appearance.&nbsp; The
modest pamphlet of 1801 had grown to a crown 8vo volume of 274
pages, bound in cloth, and issued at three shillings and
sixpence.&nbsp; It was printed in bolder type, and contained
additional information of a miscellaneous character, which,
published at a time when few general directories and books of
reference were in circulation, and local statistics difficult to
obtain, was received with favour as one of the earliest attempts
to supply the want now so fully met by local handbooks and
year-books.&nbsp; In this, as in the first edition, the
Chronology was by far the most important part of the book.&nbsp;
The 18th century &ldquo;Retrospect&rdquo; was revised and
amplified, and the record, continued from January, 1801, to
December, 1821, occupied 208 pages.&nbsp; The compiler of this
edition, and probably of the former issue, although his name did
not appear in connection therewith, was Mr. Jonathan Matchett,
the senior proprietor of the <span class="smcap">Norfolk
Chronicle</span>, who states in his preface: &ldquo;The
Chronology of Remarkable Events has been compiled principally
from the volumes of the <span class="smcap">Norfolk
Chronicle</span>, of which, with the local occurrences of the
last fifty years at least, the Retrospect may be considered an
epitome.&nbsp; Such errors of omission or commission as may be
discovered in this humble compilation shall, if pointed out, be
corrected in a future edition, if ever a third should be called
for.&rdquo;&nbsp; As no subsequent issue appeared, it may be
assumed that the demand for the work was not such as to justify
the expenditure of the time and labour necessary to its
production.&nbsp; Mr. Matchett died November 24th, 1844, and from
that time until the present no effort had been made to continue
the Chronology.</p>
<p>Little need be written by way of preface to this work.&nbsp;
It was commenced as an index to the Nineteenth Century files of
the <span class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span>, and was not, as
originally planned, intended for publication.&nbsp; The compiler,
however, was advised to elaborate his scheme and to prepare, in
place of a MS. index designed for private use, a work which would
serve the twofold purpose of continuing the excellent Chronology
begun by Mr. Matchett, and of supplying a book of reference upon
a variety of subjects pertaining to Norfolk and Norwich.&nbsp;
<!-- page xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiii</span>In Volume I. of &ldquo;Norfolk Annals&rdquo; are
recorded the events of the two decades included in the second
edition of the &ldquo;Remembrancer,&rdquo; but the matter has
been entirely re-written, and the field of research considerably
enlarged.&nbsp; With the lapse of time many things, too familiar
and commonplace to be very fully noticed in the
&ldquo;Remembrancer,&rdquo;&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the coaching
system, sports which are now obsolete, country celebrations and
observances, &amp;c.,&mdash;have acquired an interest which they
did not present to a compiler of eighty or a hundred years
ago.&nbsp; Some of the facts recorded in these pages may not in
themselves be considered &ldquo;remarkable,&rdquo; but
collectively they illustrate the manners and customs, the wisdom
and follies, the labours and amusements, of Norfolk people in the
century just closed, and, it is hoped, show to what extent the
county and city have progressed morally and socially during the
last hundred years.&nbsp; In one respect &ldquo;Norfolk
Annals&rdquo; is less pretentious than its antecessor&mdash;it
gives no topographical and statistical information of the kind
published in the &ldquo;Norfolk and Norwich Remembrancer&rdquo;;
in another sense it is more pretentious&mdash;it contains an
index, which will add to its usefulness as a book of
reference.</p>
<p>The writer is indebted to the Chairman (Sir Charles Gilman)
and the Directors of the <span class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle
Co.</span>, Limited, for permitting him to make use of the files
of that newspaper, from which exclusively the following pages
have been compiled.</p>

<h3>1801.</h3>
<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;This day (Thursday) was observed as the first day of
the Nineteenth Century.&nbsp; It was also the day upon which the
legislative Union of Great Britain and Ireland was
effected.&nbsp; At Norwich, the 13th Regiment of Light Dragoons
and the East Essex Militia fired a <i>feu de joie</i> in the
Market Place, and the Union flag was displayed upon the tower of
St. Peter Mancroft.&nbsp; At Yarmouth, there was a ceremonial
parade of the Durham Militia, and the vessels in the Roads fired
a royal salute and hoisted their new colours in honour of the
Union.&nbsp; Rain fell heavily throughout the day.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;The Norwich Theatre was opened with the performance
of &ldquo;the last new comedy, &lsquo;Life,&rsquo; and the farce,
&lsquo;Curiosity.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The manager, Mr. Hindes,
delivered an address to a crowded and fashionable audience.&nbsp;
The alterations in the house were executed after designs by Mr.
William Wilkins, the patentee, and it was said to be one of the
handsomest theatres in the provinces.</p>
<p>5.*&mdash;&ldquo;The Duke of Grafton&rsquo;s hounds unkenneled
a fox at Fakenham Wood, near Euston, and after a chase of upwards
of 50 miles in 4 hours 5 minutes, killed him at New
Buckenham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>27.*&mdash;&ldquo;A match for ten guineas (two miles) was
trotted on the turnpike road between Setch and Lynn, between Mr.
Robson&rsquo;s pony Filch and Mr. Scarfe&rsquo;s pony Fidler,
which was won with great ease by the former, he having trotted
over the ground at the rate of 18 miles an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great scarcity prevailed throughout this month.&nbsp; About
&pound;1,500 was subscribed for supplying the poor of Norwich
with soup, <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>and upwards of 247,000 quarts were
distributed.&nbsp; At Norwich market wheat was quoted at the
beginning of the month at 146s. per quarter, and rose at the end
to 180s.; barley, 84s.; and oats, 50s.&nbsp; Various expedients
were adopted to lessen the consumption of bread.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
officers of the West Norfolk Militia&rdquo; it was stated,
&ldquo;have entirely left off the use of bread at their mess, and
have forbid the use of puddings and pies, except the crust is
made of rice or potatoes, which they eat in a variety of shapes
as a substitute for bread.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nurses were advised to
use linseed meal and water instead of bread and milk in making
poultices.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>9.&mdash;Died at Postwick, aged 21, Edward West, who had
served as midshipman under Lord Nelson at the battle of the Nile,
and accompanied Capt. Sir Edward Berry in the Foudroyant.&nbsp;
In the action with the Guillaume Tell &ldquo;he received a most
severe wound, which occasioned a decline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11.&mdash;A General Fast was observed in Norwich.</p>
<p>14.*&mdash;&ldquo;It is much to be regretted that although
many large manufactures of hempen cloth are established in
Norwich, all the spinning of the hemp is done in Suffolk, and a
sufficient quantity is with difficulty obtained from
thence.&nbsp; It is suggested to establish a spinning school for
children, under the patronage of benevolent ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>17.&mdash;A company was formed at Norwich for the erection of
a &ldquo;public mill to be worked by steam for supplying the
bakers and inhabitants with flour.&rdquo;&nbsp; A capital of
&pound;12,500 was raised in transferable shares of &pound;25, and
the mill was erected upon a site near Blackfriars&rsquo;
Bridge.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;Mr. Charles Harvey, Steward of Norwich, elected
Recorder, in place of Mr. Henry Partridge, resigned.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;The price of wheat at Norwich Market was 168s. per
quarter.</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;The Anacreontic Society, &ldquo;which for many years
has been established in Norwich, and to which the cause of music
owes so much,&rdquo; closed its winter session.&nbsp; The Hon.
Mr. Wodehouse, Sir William Jerningham, Sir Richard Bedingfeld,
and Capt. Sir Edward Berry were present.&nbsp; The Society gave
monthly concerts in the Assembly Room from October to
March.&nbsp; In the advertisement announcing the commencement of
the next session, it was stated that the first concert would
&ldquo;begin precisely at 6; supper-rooms open at 9, and the
President to quit the chair at 12 o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Arrived in Yarmouth Roads, the St. George, of 98
guns, bearing the flag of Lord Nelson.&nbsp; The grand fleet of
47 ships of war (with 3,000 marines), sailed on the 12th, under
the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, in the London, of 98
guns, with Nelson as his Vice-Admiral.&nbsp; The fleet first
&ldquo;rendezvoused&rdquo; in Leith Roods, where it was joined by
seven sail of the line, and afterwards proceeded to
Copenhagen.</p>
<p><!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>10.&mdash;A mob assembled at Lynn and grossly assaulted
several millers and farmers by throwing at them stones and
dirt.&nbsp; In the evening they broke the windows in the
dining-room of the Duke&rsquo;s Head Inn.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the
ringleaders was taken to gaol, and by the active exertions of the
Rutland Militia tranquillity was restored without
bloodshed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11.*&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Kett, butcher, of Norwich, undertook to
ride his horse 50 miles in four hours.&nbsp; He started from St.
Stephen&rsquo;s Gates at 12 o&rsquo;clock, reached the 25th
milestone on the Thetford road in about 2&frac12; hours, and

Rear-Admiral Totty, on her way to join the grand fleet, got on
the Ridge, near Happisburgh Sand, and remained there till
daybreak next morning, when she floated off.&nbsp; On entering
deep water she went down immediately, with several officers and
300 men.&nbsp; Daniel Grigson, master of the Nancy cod-smack,
saved seven officers and about 190 of the crew.&nbsp; At a Court
Martial held at Sheerness, on March 31st, on Admiral Totty and
the surviving officers and crew, it was proved that the disaster
occurred through the ignorance of the pilot, and a verdict of
honourable acquittal was returned.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, held at Thetford, before Mr.
Justice Grose, the action, the King <i>v.</i> Augustus Beevor,
clerk, was tried.&nbsp; The information was filed against the
defendant by leave of the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, for
sending a challenge to Major Edward Payne, in consequence of a
dispute that had taken place between the Major and the
defendant&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; Defendant, referring to this
dispute, wrote to Major Payne, demanding an apology, &ldquo;or he
should be under the necessity of compelling it by a mode
generally used among gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; No notice was taken
of the letter, and the defendant meeting Major Payne in the
Market Place at Norwich told him publicly that &ldquo;the
contempt he had for his character protected his
person.&rdquo;&nbsp; The defendant was found guilty, and at the
next term of the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench (May 7) was
sentenced to three weeks&rsquo; imprisonment in the King&rsquo;s
Bench Prison, and ordered to enter into his own recognisances of
&pound;500, to find two sureties of &pound;250 each, and to be of
good behaviour for three years.</p>
<p>20.*&mdash;&ldquo;The remains of Miss Sophia Goddard, of the
Theatre Royal, Norwich, were interred at St. Peter
Mancroft.&nbsp; Mr. Hindes, the manager, and the principal actors
attended on the melancholy occasion.&nbsp; This young lady had
obtained considerable reputation on the Norwich boards, and was
making rapid advance to eminence in her profession when death
prematurely deprived the theatrical world of an actress whose
talents would have ensured her success on any stage.&nbsp; She
supported with great fortitude and resignation a long and painful
illness, brought on by exertions that her constitution was
unequal to, and died on Sunday last (March 15), in her 26th year,
sincerely beloved and lamented by her family and
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Died at the Cavalry Barracks, Norwich, Lieut. Robert
Scully, 13th Light Dragoons.&nbsp; His remains were interred on
Sunday, April 4th, with military honours, at St. Peter
Mancroft.</p>
<p>4.&mdash;Died at Cambridge, Mrs. Lloyd, widow of Dean Lloyd,
aged 79.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her performances in needlework were so
exquisitely wrought that they may justly be compared with the
paintings of the most celebrated artists.&nbsp; The
Transfiguration and other figures represented in the eastern
windows of Norwich Cathedral have displayed the superior skill of
her personal attainments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;Mousehold Heath, Norwich, was enclosed and

Grafton, for stealing a cow and three heifers; and James
Chettleburgh (36), for stealing six sheep at Saxlingham, were

<p>&mdash;In consequence of objections being made to the
elections of Messrs. Staff and Proctor in the Wymer Ward, and of
Messrs. Brittan and Scott in the Northern Ward, Norwich, on the
ground of their being ineligible under the Corporation Act,
having omitted to receive the Sacrament within a year previous to
the election of Common Council, the Mayor did not make the
returns till several days after the usual time.&nbsp; At a Court
held on this day, the Recorder (Mr. Harvey), after the objections
had been fully argued by counsel, declared that the persons
objected to, who had the majority of votes, having omitted to
come into Court according to summons, were not duly elected; but,
as no regular notice had been given previous to the election, the
candidates in the minority could not be returned.&nbsp; On May
2nd a rule was moved for in the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, to
show cause why a mandamus should not be directed to the Mayor of
Norwich to admit Mr. George Wymer into the office of Common
Councilman of the city.&nbsp; Similar motions were made on behalf
of Messrs. Bacon, Cooke, Fiske, and Webster, the other defeated
candidates.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord Kenyon desired counsel to take rule
to show cause, and to serve the rule not only on the Mayor, but
also on those persons who were elected in fact, but not <i>de
jure</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; On May 13th, Lord Kenyon confirmed the
decision of the Recorder that &ldquo;neither the candidates who
had the majority of votes, from their not having taken the
Sacrament, nor those in the minority were duly
elected.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another election for the wards took place
on May 25th and 26th.</p>

under the <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span

<p>23.&mdash;Died at Norwich, Mr. John Bonsell, aged 75 years,
&ldquo;an eminent leather cutter, who for upwards of 20 years
lived an abstemious life, refraining from animal food and
fermented liquors.&nbsp; He rendered himself very conspicuous in
the religious world, as he professed opinions, in a great measure
peculiar to himself, which bordered upon fanaticism.&nbsp; He
wrote several religious controversial pamphlets, as &lsquo;The
Ram&rsquo;s Horn,&rsquo; &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>25.&mdash;Comparative returns of the population of Norwich,
&ldquo;as taken in 1801, 1786, 1752, and 1693,&rdquo; were
published.&nbsp; In 1801, the population was 36,832; in 1786,
40,051; in 1752, 36,169; in 1693, 28,881.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
decrease of the population of this city since 1786 is 3,219, but
it is to be observed that 1786 was a year of peace, and that in
the returns of 1801 those serving in the Navy, Army, and Militia
are not included.&nbsp; Norwich, during the present war, has
furnished at least 4,000 recruits for the Army and Navy, and
these will account for the decrease, and also for the great
excess of females, which appears by the returns to be above
one-fourth.&nbsp; Of the present population, 408 are chiefly
employed in agriculture, and 12,267 in trade, manufactures, and
handicrafts.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>

668; Crowe, 638; Kerrison, 375; Morse, 37.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a
court of Mayoralty, held on Sunday, May 3rd, it was ruled that
Mr. Crowe was ineligible, in consequence of having served the
office three years previously to the date of the election.&nbsp;
Sir Roger Kerrison, who stood next on the poll, retired in favour
of Mr. Ives, who was thereupon declared elected, and was duly
sworn on June 16th.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Died, at Easton House, Sir Lambert Blackwell, Bart.,
aged 69.&nbsp; The title (conferred on his grandfather in 1718)

prize of &pound;15,000 in the July Irish Lottery, is the sole
property of Charles Weston, Esq., banker and brewer of this
city.&nbsp; The ticket was purchased twelve months ago, and not
being registered, the fortunate holder remained unconscious of
his wealth until last week, when, on examining the public lists,
he discovered that his ticket was a prize of the amount above
stated.&rdquo;</p>

March, 1797, for the murder of Mary Beck, of North Walsham, was
taken down by authority of the magistrates and interred on the
spot where the gibbet was erected.&nbsp; &ldquo;About ten days
back a starling&rsquo;s nest, with young ones, was taken out of
the breast of Watson, who hangs on a gibbet on Bradenham Common,
near Swaffham, for the murder of his wife, which was witnessed by
hundreds of people as something very singular and
extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;nothing more than a perforated tin box, affixed to and
vertical with the axis of a wheelbarrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; A thrashing
machine &ldquo;was much approved of.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this meeting
Mr. Coke announced his intention to give premiums for promoting
the improvement of live stock and for encouraging experimental
husbandry.</p>

Cathedral, and occasioned damage to the amount of
&pound;500.&nbsp; Bishop Manners Sutton personally distributed

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;This day, from five in the morning till ten at

the time supposed to be the cannonading from Lord Nelson&rsquo;s
fleet before Boulogne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>15.&mdash;Henry Lawn, aged 41, executed on the Castle Hill,
Norwich, for horse stealing.&nbsp; &ldquo;He denied to the last

<p>15.&mdash;The Norwich Court of Guardians considered the
question of the erection of a new workhouse.&nbsp; The average
number of poor maintained in the two workhouses during the
previous 18 years had been 1,282.&nbsp; It was recommended that
one building be erected to accommodate 1,300, the money to be
borrowed on shares of &pound;100 each, bearing interest, and to
be paid off by lot, so that the whole debt, with interest
thereon, would be discharged in 20 years.&nbsp; A Bill was
brought before Parliament and received the Royal assent on May
24th, and a site for the building was purchased near &ldquo;the
opening to Chapel Field.&rdquo;&nbsp; On December 7th, in
consequence of observations made by Mr. Alderman Rigby on the
subject of outdoor relief, the question was deferred until the
committee had informed the Court whether &ldquo;these allowances

21</span>JULY.</h4>
<p>9.&mdash;At a meeting of the deputy-lieutenants and
magistrates of the county, presided over by the Marquis
Townshend, the plan recommended by the Government, for
establishing a system of communication throughout the county and
for rendering the body of the people instrumental in the general
defence and preservation of property in case of invasion, was
approved and adopted.&nbsp; The county was formed into 13
divisions, consisting of a certain number of hundreds; each
division was placed under the charge of lieutenants of divisions,
nominated by the Lord Lieutenant; each hundred was under a
magistrate, known as an Inspector of the Hundred; and each parish
under some gentleman, clergyman, or principal farmer, termed
Superintendent of the Parish.</p>
<p>13.&mdash;On this day and on the 14th, William Green,
bricklayer, undertook at Yarmouth, for a bet of five guineas, to
lay 3,800 bricks in a workmanlike manner in 24 hours, and
completed his task in 20 hours, on a new building at the Bowling
Green House.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;Two men, named Denny and Allen, were placed in the
pillory at Norwich, in accordance with sentence passed upon them
at the Quarter Sessions on July 15th, for conspiracy against Mr.
F. Latham.&nbsp; &ldquo;Over their heads was the inscription,
&lsquo;False Conspirators.&rsquo;&nbsp; Allen wept bitterly when
he was put in, but Denny, with great effrontery, continued to nod
and smile at the numerous spectators, until the people, by a
shower of rotten eggs, and, at last, potatoes, convinced him of
their detestation and abhorrence of his character and
crime.&nbsp; This continued for about half-an-hour, when Denny,
against whom all their violence was directed, appeared to faint,
and by the advice of a medical man was taken out of the pillory
and conducted to the gaol, where, being examined by several
medical men, he was deemed to be in a fit state to be replaced on
the pillory, and was carried back for that purpose, but all
efforts to reinstate him there proved ineffectual, and he lay
thereon till the hour was expired, amidst the execrations of the
enraged multitude.&nbsp; When Denny was taken out the populace
clamorously demanded that Allen, whose appearance excited their
commiseration rather than their indignation, should be taken
down.&nbsp; Mr. Sheriff Back immediately ascended the scaffold,
and with the greatest firmness and severity expressed his
determination to enforce obedience to the laws and to carry the
sentence fully into execution.&nbsp; When the hour was expired
they were taken down and removed to the Bridewell to undergo two
years&rsquo; imprisonment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>23.*&mdash;&ldquo;All persons arrived from France and Holland
and witnessed the immense preparations which are now making for
the invasion of this country, express astonishment at the apathy
and indifference which prevail here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>24.&mdash;This day (Sunday) the Norfolk Rangers (Yeomanry
Cavalry) had a field day at Rainham Park, and subscribed
&pound;100 towards the fund instituted by the merchants of London
for the relief of persons &ldquo;who may suffer in the general
defence of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>30.*&mdash;&ldquo;At a Court of the Commissioners of Sewers,
concerning the repairing of sea breaches between Happisburgh and
Yarmouth, the jury, after hearing read three several verdicts of
former juries given <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>in 1702, 1715, and 1742, and also,
hearing several witnesses, delivered a verdict agreeable to the
above, by all of which it was determined that no particular
persons were bound to sustain or repair the sea walls adjoining
their lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;*&ldquo;The male part of the Norwich Company
(theatrical) have agreed to enroll themselves to learn the use of
arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;*&ldquo;Messrs. Marsh and Sons, Norwich and Cambridge
carriers, have within the last few days offered, for the service
of the Government in case of invasion, 100 horses, 12 broad-wheel
waggons, 24 men as drivers and assistants, 24 boats, amounting
altogether to 200 tons burden, 6 watermen, and 9 boys, with
blacksmiths, with their apparatus, tools, &amp;c., and 2
wheelwrights, and 2 harness makers, with all necessary
tools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;Major-General Money published an address on the
necessity of immediately associating, subscribing, and arming for
the defence of the county in case of invasion.&nbsp; It resulted
in the formation of Volunteer corps in all the seaports and
market towns in Norfolk.</p>
<p>Capt. John Harvey was this month promoted to be major of the
squadron of Norwich Light Horse Volunteers.</p>
<p>During this month the number of poor in the Norwich Workhouse
did not exceed 400, &ldquo;a circumstance almost
unprecedented.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>6.*&mdash;&ldquo;The Rev. Mr. Beloe, formerly of this city,
has been appointed librarian to the British Museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>9.&mdash;A brig was launched from Cattermoul&rsquo;s yard at
Thorpe, near Norwich, in the presence of many hundreds of
spectators.&nbsp; &ldquo;She went off the stocks in very fine
style, but when she was towing ashore for the company on board to
get off her, everyone endeavouring to get ashore first, the
weight of such a body of people, added to those on the rigging,
overset her.&nbsp; Nearly one hundred men, women, and children
were plunged into the water, and messengers were at once sent to
Norwich for medical assistance.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is somewhat
remarkable that no lives were lost.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;The case of Mr. Cony, a ward in Chancery, came
before the Court of Chancery.&nbsp; He was only 17 years of age,
and had married Elizabeth Franklin, the daughter of an innkeeper
at Downham Market, in which district he possessed a large
property.&nbsp; The marriage took place by licence in
London.&nbsp; The Chancellor annulled the marriage, ordering the
cessation of all further intercourse between the parties, at the
same time intimating that, if his orders were not strictly
complied with, &ldquo;he should take such steps as would prevent
the possibility of their meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>25.&mdash;Mr. George Wyer, of Downham Market, &ldquo;carried a
20 stone sack of flour one mile, leading through the town of
Watton, for a wager of 230 guineas, which he performed with great
ease in 18 minutes, to the astonishment of a vast number of
spectators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Active preparations commenced for the defence of the county in
view of possible invasion.&nbsp; On the 8th several officers and
non-commissioned officers of the 47th Regiment of Foot arrived in
Norwich <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>to receive the balloted men and
substitutes of the Army of Reserve, the training of whom
commenced next day in Chapel Field.&nbsp; A county meeting was
held at the Shirehall, Norwich, on the 10th, when resolutions
were passed, assuring his Majesty of the readiness of the county
to take defensive measures.&nbsp; A meeting of the inhabitants of
Norwich was held at the Guildhall on the 16th, at which a
subscription was opened for raising a regiment of Volunteer
Infantry.&nbsp; Clerks attended in the porch of the Guildhall to
enroll the names of the Volunteers, and the city flag was
displayed from the window of the Town Clerk&rsquo;s office.&nbsp;
On the following day 702 men had offered themselves, and by
Saturday, the 20th, the number had increased to 1,085, and the
public subscription exceeded &pound;3,000, of which &pound;500
was given by the Corporation.&nbsp; On the 26th the regiment was
formed, 800 strong, under Lieut.-Col. Harvey (commanding),
Lieut.-Col. Plumptre, and Major Sigismund Trafford.&nbsp; The
public subscription then amounted to &pound;6,400.&nbsp; A Rifle
Corps was also formed, with Mr. R. M. Bacon as captain.&nbsp; At
Yarmouth, 500 persons enrolled themselves, under the command of
Lieut.-Col. Wm. Gould.&nbsp; On the 27th, it was announced that
the number of Volunteers in the county enabled the Lord
Lieutenant to suspend the compulsory clauses of the Defence
Act.&nbsp; The total number was about 7,300.&nbsp; The Government
purchased some properties in Norwich to be converted into
temporary barracks for the reception of 800 infantry.</p>
<h4>SEPTEMBER.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;The first parade of the Norwich Regiment of Volunteer
Infantry took place.&nbsp; Eight battalion companies, a light
infantry company, and a grenadier company were formed, and
&ldquo;from five barrels of British brown stout they drank the
King&rsquo;s health and prosperity to their country and city, and
success to the corps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7.&mdash;The brass ordnance belonging to the city were tested
by some of the regular artillery stationed in Norwich.&nbsp; Four
of the guns burst, and appended to the account delivered to the
Corporation was the intimation:&mdash;&ldquo;It is customary for
the corporal to have the old metal when any of the pieces
burst.&rdquo;&nbsp; The official reply was to the effect that the
Corporation were of opinion that the corporal &ldquo;did not want
brass.&rdquo;&nbsp; The iron nine-pounders stood the test.&nbsp;
The brass gun used by Kett in 1549 was preserved as a relic.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;The Norwich Volunteers, commanded by Lieut.-Col.
Patteson, entered the Market Place, and after marching round the
Hall and saluting the Corporation, had their colours presented to
them by the Mayor.&nbsp; The men were afterwards regaled at
Neeche&rsquo;s Gardens, and the officers dined at the
King&rsquo;s Head.</p>
<p>24*&mdash;&ldquo;Telegraphs, signal flags, or tar barrels are
being stationed on all the churches and lofty edifices on the
coast, in order to give in a chain of communication the earliest
intelligence, either by night or day, of the event of the
enemy&rsquo;s landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>29.&mdash;A trial was made on the Castle ditches, Norwich, of
carriages constructed for the conveyance of troops.&nbsp; A
wooden frame, serving as a seat, was affixed to the skeleton of a
four-wheel cart.&nbsp; A board <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>for the feet
was attached to it by ropes.&nbsp; The vehicle was capable of
conveying 17 men.</p>
<h4>OCTOBER.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;At the Norfolk Quarter Sessions various resolutions
were adopted and transmitted to the Government regarding the
defence of the county.&nbsp; The principal resolution was as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;An object of most essential concern, which
this meeting think it incumbent upon them to point out, is the
town and port of Yarmouth, the infinite importance of which as
the principal and almost only naval station in the North Sea, and
the circumstances of which they do not wish to detail, but which,
they conceive, require the immediate attention of the Government,
in order that they may be rendered as secure against attack
likely to be made upon it by land as by the presence of a fleet,
it is, they presume, against any attempt by sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>15.&mdash;At a parade of the Norwich Volunteers this day
(Sunday) a letter was read from the Lord Lieutenant, asking if
they would undertake to perform permanent duty at Yarmouth.&nbsp;
A unanimous reply was given in the affirmative, and &ldquo;the
officers and gentlemen of the Light Horse Volunteers laid their
hands on their breasts, as an appeal to their honour to undertake
the duty whenever they should be required.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shortly
afterwards the commanding officers received instructions to have
their corps in a perfect state of military equipment, and be
prepared to march at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;The Artillery, Shropshire Militia, and the Volunteer
Corps (horse and foot) took part in a sham fight on Bramerton
Common.&nbsp; General Milner, the inspecting officer, commended
all arms for their steadiness on parade.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;A general fast was observed.&nbsp; The Bishop of
Norwich preached at the Cathedral, and the military attended
service in the evening.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;Died, at Norwich, Mr. Elias Norgate, aged 76.&nbsp;
He served the office of Sheriff in 1781, and of Mayor in 1785,
and was a surgeon of great local eminence.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The Lord Lieutenant transmitted to the justices of
the peace his Majesty&rsquo;s proclamation for establishing
certain regulations under the Act, respecting aliens arriving in
the kingdom or resident therein.</p>
<p>The monument to the memory of the Poet Cowper and of his
friend, Mrs. Unwin, in the church of St. Nicholas, East Dereham,
was erected this month.</p>
<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;Bonfires were prohibited in city and county,
&ldquo;as they might cause a false alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>8.&mdash;The battalion of Norwich Volunteers, commanded by
Lieut.-Col. Patteson, paraded in the Market Place at seven a.m.,
and, amid the ringing of St. Peter Mancroft bells, started on
their march to Yarmouth for the performance of garrison
duty.&nbsp; The battalion <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>halted at
Acle, and, on resuming their march, reached Yarmouth at four
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The rank and file numbered 280, out of an
establishment of 312, and two officers only were absent.&nbsp; On
the same day two troops of the Norfolk Rangers, headed by the
Marquis Townshend and commanded by Capt. Sir M. B. ffolkes,

<p>&mdash;The squadron of Norwich Light Horse, Major John Harvey,
marched to Yarmouth, to relieve the Tunstead and Happing
troop.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;Col. Harvey&rsquo;s battalion returned to Norwich
from Yarmouth.&nbsp; In the Regimental Orders, Col. Harvey
referred to the steady and orderly march on the road, to the
loyal discharge of duty at Yarmouth, and to the kindness with
which the people of that town treated the men while in
quarters.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>15.&mdash;The Lynn and Freebridge Yeomanry Cavalry, with
the artillery and rifle corps, commanded by Major Taylor, marched

<p>20.&mdash;The North Walsham Volunteers marched from that town

North Denes, was taken down by order of the Corporation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A ludicrous circumstance happened the night it was
erected.&nbsp; The different tackling being all adjusted previous
to putting down the gibbet the day before Payne was hanged, some
daring licencious bloods hoisted up a young ass by the hind legs,
to the amusement of the spectators next morning, who could not
but be surprised to find the gibbet so unexpectedly
occupied.&nbsp; In consequence, however, the tackling became so
entangled that until a young sailor undertook to climb the gibbet
the prisoner could not be suspended.&rdquo;</p>

city, may be reckoned the wonderful John Howes, from Eyke, near
Woodbridge.&nbsp; Though bereft of sight and moving in a humble
sphere of life, his arrival in Norwich was announced by the
ringing of bells, for he carries a complete peal of twelve about
with him, which, when he performs, he suspends upon a pole placed
horizontally across the backs of two chairs.&nbsp; A variety of
peals, as well as song tunes, country dances, &amp;c., he plays
with a degree of accuracy and precision that charm all those who

the Commons proposed that the representatives of the city be
instructed to oppose the Bill for erecting a bridge over the
river at Carrow Abbey.&nbsp; The motion was not agreed to by the
aldermen.&nbsp; On December 15th, a numerous meeting was held at
the Guildhall to oppose the erection of the bridge, on the ground
that it was unnecessary.&nbsp; On February 20th, 1809, Mr.
Patteson presented a petition to the House <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>of Commons,
praying for leave to bring in a Bill for carrying out the
proposal.&nbsp; On April 21st, Mr. Patteson moved the second
reading of the Carrow Bridge Bill, which was opposed by Mr. W.
Smith.&nbsp; Fourteen voted for the motion, and nine

sitting, when the second reading was carried by 48 votes to
26.&nbsp; Ultimately, the Bill received the Royal assent.&nbsp;
On July 26th, the Commissioners selected Mr. A. Brown&rsquo;s
plan for an iron bridge, and on July 31st, contracts were entered
into with Mr. J. G. Aggs for casting the ironwork; with Messrs.
Athow and De Carle for the stonework; and with Mr. N. Wyeth for
the brickwork and abutments.&nbsp; On December 18th, a
proposition was submitted to the Commissioners in favour of
abandoning the Carrow Bridge scheme, in view of the projected
erection, near the Foundry, of a bridge over the Wensum.&nbsp; It
was decided, however, to push on with the work as speedily as
possible; and the first stone was laid on April 26th, 1810, by

<h4>OCTOBER.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;Mr. Shelford Bidwell was elected Mayor of
Thetford.&nbsp; &ldquo;The usual entertainment was given to the
Corporation.&nbsp; The source from whence it was, as usual,
derived is worthy of record.&nbsp; The roast beef is provided by
the Town Clerk; the boiled beef by the tenant of the tolls of the
navigation; the geese by the tenant of the bridge tolls; the game
and wine by the Mayor-Elect; and the keeper of the tavern
adjacent to the Guildhall finds the plumb puddings.&nbsp; Is this
immemorial custom in the above very ancient borough not the
origin of the present fashionable <i>Pic Nics</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>10.&mdash;About two-thirds of Col. Patteson&rsquo;s Volunteer
Infantry were enrolled as Local Militia.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;The Norwich corn merchants demanded of the farmers a
month&rsquo;s credit, instead of paying ready money for their
corn as hitherto, but it was resisted by the growers, and
ultimately abandoned by the merchants.&nbsp; In the Court of
King&rsquo;s Bench, on November 25th, Lord Ellenborough, who was
applied to for a rule, held that individuals might buy and sell
upon terms agreed to, but combining to impose terms upon the
growers was calculated to enhance the price of grain in the
market, and to lessen the supply in the market, which was another
cause for an increased price.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;Fundenhall Church was opened, after extensive
repair.&nbsp; The chancel was almost rebuilt by Mr. T. T. Berney,
the impropriator.</p>

Norwich City Gaol under extraordinary circumstances.&nbsp; She
made a hole through the wall of the room in which she was
confined, and crept through it into the street, taking her six
months old infant with her.&nbsp; The wall was two feet in
thickness, and she must have been employed some nights in making
the aperture.&nbsp; The bricks were concealed beneath her bed,
and the loose rubbish put into the pillowcase.&nbsp; Another bed
served to conceal the hole in the wall.&nbsp; In the hue and cry
advertisement, offering a reward of ten guineas for her
recapture, it was stated that a Yarmouth hawker and pedlar, named
Thomas Cocks, &ldquo;who frequently feeds cocks for fighting in
Norfolk and Suffolk,&rdquo; was suspected of having assisted the
woman to escape.&nbsp; There is no record of her recapture.</p>

the King <i>v.</i> Larke, Mileham, and others was tried.&nbsp;
This was a prosecution for rioting in a Dissenting meeting-house
at Aylsham, and for an assault upon a preacher, named Joseph
King, on Sunday evening, March 13th, 1808.&nbsp; The defendants
behaved in a very disorderly manner in the chapel, and carried
off the minister by force to the Dog Inn.&nbsp; The case was
settled by the defendants apologising to the prosecutor in open
court, and by paying the costs of the prosecution.</p>
<p>&mdash;At the same Assizes, Lord Chief Justice Mansfield had
before him the action, Leathes, clerk, <i>v.</i> Baker.&nbsp; It
was brought by the Rector of Reedham, under a statute of Edward
VI., to recover treble the value of the tithes of corn grown on
the defendant&rsquo;s farm there, in 1808, and involved in
dispute a sum of between &pound;300 and &pound;400.&nbsp; The two
main points which the plaintiff endeavoured to substantiate were,
first, that the tenant had not set out the tithes according to
law; and, secondly, if set out, it was done fraudulently and
unfairly.&nbsp; It was proved that in one field defendant cut the
whole crop, tithed and <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>carried a part on one day, and the
remainder on the following day.&nbsp; The Judge ruled that this
mode of tithing was contrary to law, and said he was sorry to be
obliged to direct the special jury to find for the
plaintiff.&nbsp; The jury, after requesting his lordship to
inform them what was the lowest sum they could award, so as not
to subject the defendant to costs, assessed the amount at
&pound;8.&nbsp; A similar action was brought by the same
plaintiff at the Lent Assizes at Thetford, on March 19th, 1810,
against a farmer, named Maddison, when the jury found for the
defendant.&nbsp; At the Norfolk Assizes, held at Norwich, on
August 13th, 1810, before the Lord Chief Justice, Baker brought
an action against Mr. Leathes, to recover damages for
inconvenience and loss sustained by him in 1808, by reason of the
defendant allowing his tithes to remain and rot on the
plaintiff&rsquo;s land.&nbsp; A verdict was given for Baker,
damages, &pound;150.&nbsp; At the same Assizes, Mr. Leathes
brought an action against a farmer, named Long, for not setting
out his tithes according to law.&nbsp; Verdict for the plaintiff,
damages, &pound;12.</p>
<p>31.&mdash;The Grand Jury for the County held a meeting, at
which renewed efforts were commenced to procure the removal of
the Lent Assizes from Thetford to Norwich.&nbsp; It was decided
to petition Parliament with that object.&nbsp; At Norwich Quarter
Sessions, on October 3rd, the Grand Jury made a presentment,
asking the city magistrates to co-operate with the county
justices.&nbsp; On October 11th, the Norwich Corporation resolved
to aid the county in the application to Parliament, and in
February, 1810, a petition in favour of the removal was presented
in the House of Commons by Mr. Patteson.</p>

<p>25.*&mdash;&ldquo;Some idea of the extent of Norfolk farms may
be formed when it is known that one occupier in the western
district last year expended more than &pound;1,100 for only one

disrespect, and said he would perform his office irrespective of
outward forms.&nbsp; He denied having assumed the office.&nbsp;

resided in the neighbourhood of Norwich, has written from Botany

(In the year 1786 Cabel and a female prisoner were in Norwich
Castle under sentence of transportation.&nbsp; During the two
years that elapsed between the trial and the departure of the
first batch of convicts, the woman gave birth to a child.&nbsp;
Cabel, the father, was passionately fond of the infant, and

mother.&nbsp; This was refused.&nbsp; The female and her infant
were sent with the first contingent of convicts, and after a
wearisome journey by coach in the depth of winter arrived at
Plymouth in charge of Simpson, the turnkey of the prison.&nbsp;
When Simpson handed over his prisoners to the captain of the
transport that officer refused to take the child on board,
alleging that he had no authority to do so.&nbsp; The mother was
distracted by the separation.&nbsp; Simpson acted with great
humanity.&nbsp; Taking with him the six weeks old child he
proceeded to London by coach, and with much difficulty obtained
an interview with the Secretary of State, to whom he related the
story.&nbsp; The result was that not only was an order issued for
the restoration of the child to its mother, but Cabel was
permitted to sail by the same transport to the land of their
exile.)</p>

Justice Mansfield and a special jury, an indictment was preferred
against the keeper of the county gaol for suffering a prisoner to
escape.&nbsp; The indictment had been moved by <i>certiorari</i>
from the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, and was tried at <i>nisi
prius</i>.&nbsp; The main question was whether or not the
magistrates of the borough of Castle Rising had legally the power
of commitment to the county gaol.&nbsp; They had in this case
exercised such power, and the gaoler had accepted the delinquent
into his custody and given a receipt for him, but afterwards, on
the advice of one of the visiting justices, had suffered him to
go at large.&nbsp; The Lord Chief Justice thought it a question
for decision in Westminster Hall rather than for an Assize of
<i>oyer</i> and <i>terminer</i>.&nbsp; Prosecuting counsel
disclaimed all intention of enforcing the punishment of the
gaoler, and the facts were all admitted on the part of the
county, whereupon the special jury, <i>pro forma</i>, found the
defendant guilty.</p>

including a dinner on the polling day, and a ball and supper on
the following evening.&nbsp; Mr. Mingay and Lord William Fitzroy
were returned, but the former had been unseated, and several
questions arose as to his personal liability: first, whether or

jointly liable with his colleague; and fourth, whether or not
upon the event of his death such liability vested in the

deceased.&nbsp; The defendants endeavoured to show that the
expense of the entertainments was incurred by the Corporation of

<i>foreign barley</i> have arrived this week at Yarmouth, which
were purchased in London, and that the greater part is already
brought to this city (Norwich), where it will be malted.&nbsp; It
is a novel circumstance to have barley in the London markets at

Pedestrian Hobby Horses have been exhibited here this week.&nbsp;

seat or saddle is fixed on a perch upon two double shod wheels,
running after each other, so that they can go upon the
footways.&nbsp; To preserve a balance a small board covered and
stuffed is placed before on which the arms are laid, and in front
of which is a little guiding pole, which is held in the hand to
direct the route.&nbsp; The swiftness with which a person can
travel is almost beyond belief&mdash;eight, nine, or even ten
miles an hour may be done on good level ground.&rdquo;</p>

unremitting exertions to improve the public roads.&nbsp; It was
one of his fixed opinions that the roads might be kept in a good
state of repair by the fair performance of the Statute duty
without the imposition of tolls, and he practically evinced the
truth of the opinion which he had formed.&nbsp; In the attainment

<p>&mdash;*&ldquo;Notwithstanding the clouds which lower on the
landed interest, the sun of Holkham&rsquo;s prosperity has shone
forth with undiminished splendour,&rdquo; was the comment which
prefaced this year&rsquo;s report of the Holkham Sheep
Shearing.&nbsp; The business of the meeting commenced with an
inspection in front of the hall &ldquo;of the various processes
in the manufacture (by the labourers&rsquo; children and the
parish poor) of part of the crop of flax and hemp grown upon
Holkham Park Farm in the last year.&nbsp; The several operations
of breaking, heckling, and spinning were gone through by females

shown.&nbsp; The gathering was attended by H.R.H. the Duke of
Sussex, the Duke of Bedford, the Earl of Albemarle, Lord Erskine,
Lord Crewe, Sir F. Burdett, Mr. Hume, &amp;c.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
<!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>magnificent hospitality of these meetings congregated
men from all parts of the civilized world.&nbsp; None but
agricultural subjects were discussed.&nbsp; On these the most
conflicting opinions were freely given and as freely canvassed,
but anything political was excluded.&nbsp; And thus, although the
political opinions of Mr. Coke and most of his personal friends
were not only very decided, but for a great period, and that the
most brilliant era of the Holkham meetings, unpopular with the
great majority of those connected with the landed interest, yet
men of every shade of political opinion were heartily welcome . .
. and although they might hear some favourite theory of farming
ridiculed they never would find anything hurtful to their
political feelings advanced.&nbsp; The Sheep Shearing of 1821,
indeed, was an exception.&nbsp; Political topics were then
introduced.&nbsp; It was a bad omen.&nbsp; This Sheep Shearing
was the last.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Journal of the Royal

for the recovery of the cost of a suit of clothes, &amp;c.,
bought by the plaintiff in consequence of having received from
the defendant a fictitious card of invitation to dine at the
Guild feast in 1820.&nbsp; The defendant, who admitted the
sending of the card, was heard to remark that &ldquo;he would
rather undergo transportation than not see the plaintiff (a Jew
dentist) at the door of the Guildhall in his pomps and opera
hat.&rdquo;&nbsp; Counsel for the defendant endeavoured to show
that the order for the apparel was given subsequent to the
plaintiff receiving notice of the fictitiousness of the card; and
he argued that even if he had gone to the feast he could not have
partaken of it without incurring the censure of the higher orders
of his religion.&nbsp; Mr. Sergeant Blossett, for the plaintiff,
replied that &ldquo;of the 600 covers placed on the tables on
Guild Day there were several of which Mr. Crawcour might partake
without injury either of his soul or his stomach.&rdquo;&nbsp;

Crawcour on September 23rd met with a terrible accident on

obtain his discharge, the Act for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors

Norfolk Hotel, Norwich, to remonstrate against the selection of

keep.&mdash;On July 11th some workmen employed on the building
were raising a large stone, which fell and injured four of them,

being held therein on October 15th, 1823, which was the first
occasion on which the building was used.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to the
prison buildings the ancient Saxon castle with Bigod&rsquo;s
tower is left entire in its pristine state.&nbsp; The hill is now
surrounded with a castellated wall of Aberdeen granite 20 feet
high, leaving, however, in general a space of nearly 20 feet for
a public promenade on the summit of the hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Castle ditches and meadow had previously been improved at
considerable expense by the city.&nbsp; These works completed the
first part of the extensive scheme undertaken by the county.</p>

<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;A party of thieves, known as the &ldquo;Cossey
gang,&rdquo; committed great depredations in the neighbourhood of
Norwich.&nbsp; On the night of the 2nd they broke into the Half
Moon public-house, Stone Hills, and stole sixteen gallons of
spirits and other property.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tired of committing
depredations on foot, about ten o&rsquo;clock at night, as soon
as they find those who keep horses are gone to bed, they resort
to the stables and take out what horses they want, ride to the
spot of depredation, whether for game, poultry, sheep, &amp;c.,
and when done return the horses almost jaded and harassed to
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; (See August 2nd, 1822.)</p>
<p>9.&mdash;The Marquis of Titchfield was elected without
opposition as member of Parliament for King&rsquo;s Lynn, in
place of Sir Martin Browne ffolkes, deceased.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;The poor of Norwich and its neighbourhood were
informed by advertisement that medical and surgical advice was
given free at the Infirmary for Diseases of the Eye, St
Benedict&rsquo;s, Norwich (late Messrs. Day&rsquo;s bank), by Mr.
L. Evans, M.D., physician, and Messrs. Robert Hull and T.
Martineau, jun., surgeons.&nbsp; At a public meeting held on July
11th, under the presidency of Sir Robert J. Harvey, it was
resolved that &ldquo;the Norfolk and Norwich Infirmary for
Diseases of the Eye, instituted and supported by Dr. Evans, Mr.
Hull, and Mr. T. Martineau, has already been productive of great
advantage, and is deserving of public support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;A meeting of the proprietors and occupiers of land was
held at the Shirehouse, Norwich, &ldquo;for the purpose of taking
into consideration the present most truly alarming state of
agriculture.&rdquo;&nbsp; The High Sheriff (Sir Jacob Astley)
presided.&nbsp; Resolutions were adopted urging the diminution of
taxation by means of rigid economy, the repeal of one half of the
Malt Tax, and the removal of the heavy imposts upon candles,
salt, leather, &amp;c.&nbsp; A petition embodying these views was
ordered to be presented to the House of Commons.&nbsp; After this
date many similar meetings were held in the principal towns and
villages in the Hundreds of the county, ostensibly for the
purpose of suggesting remedies for agricultural distress and of
promoting Parliamentary reform.&nbsp; It was alleged that many of
these gatherings were of a party character, and on May 18th, the
<span class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span> observed: &ldquo;The
discussion of agricultural distress was last week suspended, and
the mask of Parliamentary Reform entirely thrown off by those
<!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>who for the last four months have displayed so much
violence against the Government in pursuing the one, and casting
so much obloquy upon Parliament in assuming the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>24.&mdash;The annual dinner held at Norwich in celebration of
the birthday of Fox was attended by H.R.H. the Duke of Sussex,
the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Albemarle (who presided), Mr. T.

gentry of the county.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;Two Corsican stags, presented by Lord Maynard to Mr.
Robert Hamond, gave the Westacre Hunt good sport this
season.&nbsp; &ldquo;The first was turned off at Rougham on the
28th, and gave them a severe chase of nearly three hours, from
the effects of which two horses died.&nbsp; They are very
superior to the red deer of this country from their capability to
endure extreme fatigue and to take the most extraordinary
leaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>31.&mdash;Norwich Theatre was opened for the season with the
grand spectacle of &ldquo;The Coronation.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;Lord Henry Cholmondeley was elected Member of

or thirty horses and carts were in waiting to remove the
contraband goods.&nbsp; Two of the smugglers were wounded in the
affray.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Lynn Theatre was opened under the management of Mr.
T. Marsters.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;Skipper, the Norwich pedestrian, walked 50 miles in
a few minutes under eleven hours at Lynn.</p>
<p>23.*&mdash;&ldquo;We understand that the manufactory of
bombazines and crapes in Norwich is likely to be affected from
the circumstance of those articles being now made in considerable
quantities in various parts of Lancashire at a much lower rate of
wages for the weaving than that which is paid here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&mdash;Married, by special licence, at the house of the
Earl of Albemarle, St. James&rsquo;s Square, London, by the Lord
Bishop of Norwich, Mr. Thomas William Coke, M.P., of Holkham, to
Lady Anne Keppel, second daughter of the earl.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;The machine breaking riots commenced in
Norfolk.&nbsp; Upwards of a hundred labourers assembled at
Kenninghall, and seized the threshing machine of Mr. Bailey, a
farmer.&nbsp; The Rev. J. Surtees, of Banham, a county justice,
at once proceeded to a neighbouring farm where an auction was
being held, and, in the King&rsquo;s name, requested the
auctioneer and the farmers present to assist him in quelling the
disturbance.&nbsp; The whole party rode over to Kenninghall, and
after <!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>the Riot Act had been read the mob
dispersed.&nbsp; On March 4th there were further riotous
assemblies at Attleborough, Shropham, Buckenham, Banham,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The Eye troop of Yeomanry Cavalry were called out,
and of the 30 rioters secured eight who were regarded as
ringleaders, and they were sent to Norwich Castle under cavalry
escort.&nbsp; The Yeomanry after lodging the prisoners in gaol
were assailed by a Norwich mob, who stoned them in the streets,
and attacked the Trowel and Hammer public-house, St.
Stephen&rsquo;s, where they had halted to bait their
horses.&nbsp; The troopers returned to headquarters at East
Harling after a march of eighty miles in twenty hours.&nbsp; Many
prisoners were also committed to the Castle from other districts,
and several cases of incendiarism were reported.&nbsp; At the
adjourned Quarter Sessions for the county, held at Norwich on the
6th, the rioters were tried and sentenced to various terms of
imprisonment in the Bridewells and houses of correction in the
county.&nbsp; A guard of the West Norfolk Militia was stationed
at the Castle, and a squadron of the Norwich Light Horse
Volunteers did duty at the Cavalry Barracks until relieved by the
16th Lancers.&nbsp; The Lancers and Light Horse afterwards acted
as escorts to the vans by which the prisoners were conveyed to
the different prisons.&nbsp; On the march the military were
repeatedly stoned by the mobs.&nbsp; Detachments of the 7th
Dragoon Guards were stationed at Hingham and Attleborough, and
remained at those places until the lawless disposition manifested
by the rural population had subsided.</p>

Justice Richards, William Hardiment and Benjamin Neal, who were
concerned with James Johnson in the murder of Mr. Baker at
Wells-next-the-Sea on October 11th, 1817, were put upon their
trial.&nbsp; Hardiment had evaded apprehension, and at the Spring
Assizes in 1818 the bill charging Neal as an accessory was thrown
out by the Grand Jury.&nbsp; Several witnesses now deposed to
having seen Johnson and Hardiment in company at about the time of
the murder, and two persons confined in Aylsham bridewell at the
same time that Hardiment and Neal were prisoners there gave
evidence as to hearing conversations between the two when
planning the murder.&nbsp; One of these witnesses (Thomas
Robinson), on December 24th, 1821, met Hardiment at Beverley, in
Yorkshire, and gave information which led to his arrest.&nbsp;
The jury found Hardiment guilty, and acquitted Neal.&nbsp;
Hardiment was executed on the Castle Hill, Norwich, at noon on
April 1st in the presence of an immense crowd of
spectators.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not more than three yards from the
gallows a boy was knocked down by a gentleman who detected him
picking his pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;At the same Assizes, before Mr. Justice Richards, the
cause Lock, D.D., <i>v.</i> the Bishop of Norwich was
tried.&nbsp; In consequence of <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>simony
alleged to have been committed by the Rev. Dr. Lock, the patron
of the advowson of Hilgay, the Crown had seized the living and
presented the Rev. Dr. Hewlett thereto on April 6th, 1819.&nbsp;
This action of <i>quare impedit</i> was instituted by the
plaintiff to try the right of the Crown to such
presentation.&nbsp; The defendant raised three pleas: (1) that
the Rev. John Royle being seized of the living of Hilgay it was
corruptly agreed that Lock should resign the living of Compton
Martin, in Somersetshire, and cause him (Royle) to be presented
to it, and also that Lock should pay Royle the sum of
&pound;12,900 for the advowson of Hilgay, and that in
consideration of the promises Royle should resign the living and
cause Lock to be presented to it.&nbsp; (2) That Lock being
seized of the living of Hilgay did corruptly agree with one James
Craddock, that in consideration of the said Craddock paying to
him the sum of &pound;25,000 he (Lock) should convey to Craddock
the advowson of Hilgay, and also resign the living and cause him
(Craddock) to be presented to it.&nbsp; (3) That Lock, being
seized of Hilgay, having presented Craddock, did corruptly agree
that, in consideration of Lock abandoning certain proceedings in
an action for debt against Craddock, he should forego proceedings
upon a bill of indictment for perjury preferred by Lock against
Craddock, but Lock corruptly prevailed upon Craddock to resign
the living in order that he (Lock) might present himself to
it.&nbsp; The jury gave a verdict for the Crown generally upon
all pleas.&nbsp; The Judge: A very proper verdict.&nbsp; It is
very disgraceful dealing, gentlemen.</p>

<p>4.*&mdash;&ldquo;Last week two gentlemen on searching the
burial ground belonging to the Roman camp at Caister discovered
the remains of a kiln with several urns upon it as they were
placed for burning.&nbsp; Antiquaries having doubted whether urns
found at Caister were burnt in a fire or only dried in the sun,
the discovery of this kiln may be decisive of the
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11.&mdash;A county meeting was held at the Shirehouse,
Norwich, &ldquo;for the purpose of taking into consideration the
propriety of presenting a petition to Parliament for a reform in
the representation of the people.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a
crowded gathering, and much confusion prevailed until the High
Sheriff (Sir R. P. Jodrell) adjourned the meeting to the Castle
Hill, where the speeches were delivered from waggons.&nbsp; Sir
Thomas Beevor moved a series of resolutions, the sixth of which
stated &ldquo;that a petition be presented to the House of
Commons praying that the House will forthwith give to the people
a real representation in place of that corrupt and defective one
which now exists.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. S. T. Southwell seconded the
resolutions, which were put <i>seriatim</i> and carried <i>nem.

Lord Walpole commenced.&nbsp; The candidates were Col. the Hon.
John Walpole, brother of the late member, and Sir William Browne
ffolkes.&nbsp; Considerable disturbance prevailed throughout the
contest.&nbsp; About 40 voters had polled for each candidate,
when the mob demolished Col. Walpole&rsquo;s polling booth, set
fire to the materials, and stoned the poll clerks.&nbsp; They
then proceeded to the Duke&rsquo;s Head Inn, smashed the windows,
tore the Corporation flag to pieces, and committed other acts of
violence.&nbsp; The polling was adjourned until the 28th, when
the disturbances were renewed, and a further postponement was
rendered necessary, the numbers then standing: Walpole, 137;
ffolkes, 72.&nbsp; About three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon a
detachment of the 7th Dragoon Guards arrived from Norwich, under
the command of Lieut. Everard.&nbsp; One of the ringleaders of

of payment.&nbsp; Meetings of the men were called, and the
employers were requested to reconsider the question.&nbsp;
Another meeting was accordingly held on the 9th, when <!-- page
210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>Mr. Beloe urged that the proposals of the employers
were ill-advised.&nbsp; On the other hand it was stated that
goods were being manufactured in Yorkshire in large quantities at
much lower rates than in Norwich.&nbsp; It was contended by the
weavers that greatly increased demands had been made upon them
for house rent and coals, and that it was impossible for them to
live on reduced wages.&nbsp; A further statement was made to the
effect that the lowering of prices would tend to inferior
workmanship.&nbsp; A mob assembled outside the Guildhall and
cheered or hooted the different manufacturers whom they deemed
friendly or adverse to their claims.&nbsp; One gentleman, Mr.
William Bosley, was very roughly handled, and his hat, coat, and
shoes were taken from him and torn to pieces.&nbsp; It was
considered necessary to summon the assistance of the 7th Dragoon
Guards, but the mob dispersed after the announcement had been
made from the leads of the Guildhall that the manufacturers had
consented to return to the old prices.&nbsp; The weavers spent
the 10th in festivity and rejoicing.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;Died, William Coward, aged 85, for 54 years parish

<p>&mdash;A camping match took place at Ranworth, in the presence
of 6,000 spectators, between men of the Blofield and of the
Tunstead and Happing Hundreds.&nbsp; &ldquo;So closely were the
men (ten a side) matched for strength, courage, skill, and
activity that the ball was nearly in the centre of the ground
when time was called and play stopped.&nbsp; At the conclusion of
the camp, Turner, of Witton, and Riches, of Upton, had a
pugilistic trial of manhood.&nbsp; A well-fought battle of
thirty-two rounds of hard milling, with little or no science,
ended in favour of Riches.&rdquo;</p>

in the kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; The new members included Miss
Wensley, Mrs. Dowton, Mr. Osbaldiston, and Mr. Ford White.&nbsp;
Mrs. Dowton was a favourite actress in the Norfolk and Suffolk

Justice Best, James Smith was indicted for breaking into the
house of William Balls, the Half Moon, Stone Hills, near Norwich,
and stealing on January 2nd 16 gallons of liquors in bottles, a
purse containing &pound;8 in notes and cash, a quantity of copper
coin, &amp;c.&nbsp; He was found guilty and sentenced to
death.&nbsp; (Although it was not stated at the trial, the
prisoner was evidently one of the &ldquo;Cossey gang&rdquo;
referred to under date January 2nd, 1822.)&nbsp; At the Norwich
Assizes, Henry Carter was sentenced to death for entering the
dwelling-house of John Clarke, of St. Paul&rsquo;s, and stealing
therein several articles.&nbsp; The execution of these men was
carried out under revolting circumstances on August 24th.&nbsp;
From an early hour in the morning they were incessantly appealed
to by the chaplain of the gaol and a Wesleyan minister to
acknowledge the justice of their sentence.&nbsp; The procession
from the gaol in St Giles&rsquo; Street to the scaffold was
headed by the Under Sheriffs on horseback; the Sheriffs
accompanied by the chaplain and the minister came next in a
mourning coach, &ldquo;followed by a cart covered with black
cloth on which sat the two malefactors each with arms pinioned,
neck bare, and head uncovered, each sitting on the coffin
destined to receive his lifeless body.&rdquo;&nbsp; Smith was
well behaved, but Carter acted with great levity during the
progress of the procession through the Market Place to the
scaffold erected near the weighing machine on the Castle Meadow,
and on the very drop itself &ldquo;he seemed to evince perfect
indifference to the fate which awaited him.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
hanging for an hour &ldquo;the bodies were carried by twelve
bearers to the house of Carter&rsquo;s parents in St.
Margaret&rsquo;s, and were buried on the 26th in the churchyard
of that parish.&rdquo;</p>

Yarmouth, between the gentlemen of that town and of
Norwich.&nbsp; Yarmouth won eleven mains and five byes, and
Norwich nine mains and seven byes.&nbsp; &ldquo;The feeder for
Norwich (Nash) proved the excellence of his management.&nbsp; On
Wednesday evening the Norwich cock was pounded and taken by Nash,
and from the superiority of his condition afterwards won the
battle.&nbsp; In the second pit the same evening one of the
Norwich cocks had his thigh broken in the first part of the
battle, and afterwards fought two hours, and at one time brought
the odds from ten to one against him to the same odds in his
favour.&nbsp; He, however, eventually lost.&nbsp; This battle
would have been withdrawn, but as the money depended upon it they
were induced to continue it.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Bets to the amount of several thousand pounds were
dependent upon the match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11.&mdash;His Majesty the King passed off Yarmouth on his
voyage to Scotland.&nbsp; &ldquo;About half past five
o&rsquo;clock two steam tugs were seen with the Royal yacht in
tow, and thousands of persons crowded to the jetty and
beach.&rdquo;&nbsp; The vessels steered a course outside the
Roads; but the Perseverance yawl put off with thirty persons on
board, &ldquo;and had the good fortune to fall in with the yacht
as it was weathering the Newarp floating light.&nbsp; The company
in the boat gave four cheers for the King, who came on board and
returned the salutation.&rdquo;&nbsp; On his return voyage on
Saturday, August 31st, his Majesty passed through the Roads, and
the yacht came close in shore.&nbsp; &ldquo;His Majesty was
greatly disappointed in not receiving a supply of fresh
provisions which had been previously ordered to be ready for him
on his arrival off the town.&nbsp; The letter arrived two hours
after the King had passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>12.&mdash;Marshland free bridge and causeway were opened for
the use of the public.&nbsp; A procession, led by the carriage of
Mr. Thomas Hoseason, and followed by those of Sir Thomas Hare,
Mr. Anthony Hamond, and others started from the South Gates,
Lynn, preceded by a band of music.&nbsp; On the arrival of the
procession at the foot of the bridge the horses were taken out of
Mr. Hoseason&rsquo;s carriage and men who had been employed on

great confusion prevailed at intervals.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman
Thurtell moved a string of resolutions in favour of the reduction
of taxation and the abolition of needless and, therefore, useless
places, pensions, and sinecures, such a reduction of the National
Debt as was required; and the total repeal of the Malt and Beer
taxes, which would relieve heavy burdens and encourage the growth
of barley.&nbsp; Mr. George Watson seconded the
resolutions.&nbsp; Mr. Cobbett, amid great uproar, then moved, as
an amendment to Mr. Thurtell&rsquo;s resolutions, that a petition
be presented to Parliament containing among other suggestions the

commonly called Church property, to be applied to the liquidation
of the National Debt; the abolition of the standing army; the
total abolition of sinecure pensions, grants, and emoluments; the
sale of numerous public estates commonly called Crown lands, and
the application of the money towards the liquidation of the
public debt; to suspend by law for one year all distraints for
rents; to suspend all processes for tithes for the same period,
and all processes arising out of mortgages effected on houses or
land; and to repeal the taxes on malt, hops, leather, soap, and
candles.&nbsp; Not three-fourths of the audience were able to
hear the reading of the petition, but it was adopted, and the
resolutions moved by Mr. Thurtell negatived by at least twenty to
one.&nbsp; Mr. Cobbett, at the close of the meeting, stood
forward and said this was the greatest triumph he had ever had;
it was their triumph also&mdash;the triumph of truth and sound
principles.&nbsp; Subsequently meetings were held in the various
Hundreds of the county &ldquo;to disavow the Norwich proceedings
of the 3rd,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to express abhorrence and
detestation of the revolutionary doctrines promulgated, and the
measures of fraud and spoliation recommended for legislative
adoption.&rdquo;&nbsp; On March 8th the <span

paragraph: &ldquo;Norfolk Petition.&nbsp; Serious loss.&nbsp; We
understand the county has been so unfortunate as to be deprived

this important document, but without success.&rdquo;</p>

that they reached Norwich at a quarter before five o&rsquo;clock,

condemned felons.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a dungeon at Thetford,
thirteen feet below the surface of the ground, measuring eighteen

Chancellor, stating that the twelve Judges had unanimously
decided against the removal of the Lent Assizes from

Jury for the county presented an address to the Judges expressing
regret at their decision, and pointing out that the chief
benefits contemplated by the recent Act of Parliament for the
regulation of gaols must be in a great degree frustrated by a
continuance of the then state of things in Norfolk.&nbsp;

Alderman Thomas Thurtell, of Norwich, the father of the culprit,

the writer commiserated with him in his great affliction.&nbsp;
In the same paper was another letter addressed by Mr. N.
Bolingbroke, of Norwich, to the High Sheriff of Hertfordshire, in
which he wrote: &ldquo;It may appear to some that he (the father)

unhappy son; but you may be assured, Sir, that there was no part
of his conduct which could not be satisfactorily explained.&nbsp;
He has generally acted under the advice of Mr. Unthank, a

opinion can be formed without a knowledge of the motives by which
such have been influenced.&rdquo;</p>

paper about 60 years ago and affords a curious instance of the
then stage coach celerity: &lsquo;A wain will set off on Thursday

aged 78, Mr. Benjamin Guyton, who for many years followed what
may justly be called the first of occupations&mdash;a gardener
and horticulturist.&nbsp; His skill in the knowledge and
properties of plants and vegetables could only be equalled by his
ingenuity in delineating with his pencil the curious productions
of nature, particularly those of the insect tribe.&nbsp; Some few
specimens of his art, in the various species of papilio, are in
the possession of some gentlemen in this city, who knew how to
appreciate merit though found in an obscure individual moving in
a humble sphere of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;Died, &ldquo;greatly and justly esteemed by all his old
comrades and friends,&rdquo; Capt. John Borrow, many years
adjutant of the First or West Norfolk Regiment of Militia.</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;At a meeting of manufacturers and others at the
Guildhall, Norwich, under the presidency of Mr. John Harvey,
resolutions were adopted expressing satisfaction with the
proposal of the Government to reduce the duties on raw and thrown
silks as well as on foreign wools; but they viewed with surprise
and alarm the proposal to allow the free exportation of British
wool, &ldquo;as a consequence of supplying foreigners with the
raw material must be to throw out of employment many thousands of
the labouring poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6.&mdash;Intelligence was received at Lynn of the death, which
occurred on the 5th, of the Marquis of Titchfield, M.P.&nbsp; A
writ for the election of a new member was moved for in the House
of Commons on the 9th, and two candidates, Lord John C. Bentinck,
eldest brother of the deceased marquis, and successor to the
title, and Sir William Browne ffolkes, Bart., immediately issued
addresses.&nbsp; The election took place on March 19th.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sir William ffolkes, after leaving the hustings, was
carried in a chair round the Market Place and down High Street,
he addressed the crowd from the window of his committee-room, and
threw amongst them a large quantity of silver coin, which was
eagerly scrambled for.&rdquo;&nbsp; The result of the polling was
declared as follows: Marquis of Titchfield; 177; Sir William
ffolkes, 89.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;A meeting of the manufacturers, merchants, and
others interested in the silk trade was held at the Guildhall,
Norwich, under the presidency of Mr. Alderman Roberts, to take
into consideration the resolutions passed by the House of Commons
relative to alterations in the silk duties.&nbsp; A resolution
was moved to the effect that the meeting viewed with satisfaction
the measures proposed for the extension of the silk manufactory,
&ldquo;but the object could not fully be attained by the proposed
immediate remission of so great a proportion of the duties on raw
and thrown silks.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was advocated that endeavours
be made to obtain compensation for the loss sustained upon stocks
of manufactured goods, and a petition to Parliament <!-- page
231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>embodying that view was adopted.&nbsp; On April 5th
&ldquo;an unusual scene was witnessed in Norwich, that being the
last day on which manufacturers of the city warehoused their raw
and foreign silk in order to obtain the drawback according to the
late decision of Parliament.&nbsp; The number of pieces of
bombazines and crapes bonded was about 40,000, which may be
averaged at 7s. 6d. each, and the total amount of the drawback
will be &pound;30,000.&nbsp; Such of the goods as are for
exportation are already returned to the owners, and an order is
expected in a few days for the delivery of those intended for the
home trade.&nbsp; By this arrangement, which was recommended to
Government by a gentleman deputed from Norwich, little time will
be lost, and the manufacturer will obtain the relief which, but
for its adoption, would, under the late alteration of the law,
have proved highly injurious to many of our fellow
citizens.&rdquo;&nbsp; On June 23rd a dinner was given at the
Rampant Horse Inn by the merchants and manufacturers to Mr. John
Harvey, Mr. E. T. Booth, and Mr. T. O. Springfield, &ldquo;for
the zeal and ability with which they promoted the interests of
the trade, and for their successful exertions in obtaining the
drawback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11.&mdash;Died at his house in Chapel Field, Norwich, in his
71st year, Mr. John Clayton Hindes, many years manager of the

<p>8.&mdash;A performance was given at Norwich Theatre by the
Stagorians.&nbsp; &ldquo;The stage exhibited the appearance of
the interior of a Stagorian lodge, and presented a spectacle at
once novel and striking.&nbsp; In accordance with the principles
of the assembled brethren the ceremony opened with &lsquo;God
save the King,&rsquo; and closed with the last verse of that same
loyal strain.&nbsp; The whole was conducted and well supported by
Mr. Hudson, treasurer of the lodge No. 2, Independent, who sang a
song in so good a style that the audience testified their
approbation by loud and repeated cheerings.&rdquo;</p>

surgeon, and founder of the Ebenezer Chapel in Ber Street,

after the tempest a cloud of immense magnitude and extreme
density, having the appearance of a mass of snow, passed over the

Wells, &ldquo;did grievously with his hands and feet assault the
plaintiff,&rdquo; a maiden lady, in the same town, to whom had
been bequeathed a house, which, it was supposed, entitled her to
the use of a certain pew in the parish church.&nbsp; Defendant
contested the right, locked the pew, and nailed over the door a
piece of wood to prevent entry thereto.&nbsp; When plaintiff

<p>1.&mdash;Lord Chief Justice Abbott and Lord Chief Baron
Alexander, Judges of Assize, were received at Harford Bridge,

a procession was formed in the following order:&mdash;Two blue
coats on horseback; justices and aldermen of Norwich in their
carriages; city Sheriffs&rsquo; officers on horseback; the Under
Sheriff&rsquo;s ditto; the Sheriffs in a carriage and four; two

postillions, and footmen in livery, with his chaplain, the Rev.
Edward Bellman; servants on horseback; Sir Robert John Harvey and
Mr. George Harvey, the High Sheriff&rsquo;s sons, in a
chariot.&nbsp; It is said that a similar procession has not taken
place here for the last 100 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, held at Norwich before Lord
Chief Justice Abbott, the action Fellowes <i>v.</i> Steward,
clerk, was tried, with the object of deciding whether the
plaintiff had set out his tithe in a manner warranted by
law.&nbsp; The plaintiff&rsquo;s men cut the tithe wheat on seven
acres of land, each man taking a strip or rig of land, and after
cutting each strip returned and put his sheaves into shocks of
ten each.&nbsp; The plaintiff&rsquo;s bailiff set out the tithe
by taking every tenth sheaf from the shock and placing it a yard
or two from the rest.&nbsp; He then put a bough on every sheaf so
laid apart, and replaced it in the shock whence he had taken
it.&nbsp; The next day the sheaves, except those marked as tithe,
were carted.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Steward, of Norwich, who was
acting as agent for his son, the rector of Saxlingham, stated
that the corn should be tithed in sheaves before it was
shocked.&nbsp; Mr. Fellowes endeavoured to prove that the corn
had been set out according to the custom of the place.&nbsp; The
Judge censured the plaintiff for adopting the method of
separating the tithe corn from the other corn and mixing it with
the shock again, as it opened the door to the practice of all
kinds of fraud.&nbsp; The plaintiff was non-suited.</p>

Abbott, the <i>qui tam</i> action Woodewis <i>v.</i> J. S.

248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>by
which persons trading in excisable liquors were precluded from
taking part, as magistrates, in licensing proceedings.&nbsp; It
was alleged that Mr. Patteson interfered, on the application of
the plaintiff, to have a house licensed for the sale of
home-brewed beer and London porter in Fishgate Street, Norwich,
nearly opposite one belonging to himself.&nbsp; The answer was
that this was an attempt to fix a stigma on the character of Mr.
Patteson.&nbsp; The Judge said the jury could find a verdict for
the plaintiff without impeaching the character of the
defendant.&nbsp; The jury returned the following verdict:
&ldquo;We give the plaintiff &pound;100 damages; at the same time
we entertain a very high opinion of the high honour and good
faith of Alderman Patteson and the other gentlemen of the
Corporation.&rdquo;</p>

Commissioners on January 24th decided to macadamise Ber Street in
order to afford relief work, and in March the manufacturers, with
the same object, commenced making bombazetts and twilled stuffs,
articles that were entirely new to Norwich.&nbsp; On March 10th

the loan of &pound;80,000 for four months at the rate of <!--

manufactures, who granted &pound;600 to the unemployed weavers,

on July 4th increased the mulct for the ensuing quarter to
&pound;15,000; and in August offered to obtain employment for a
considerable number of distressed weavers if they would consent
to a slight reduction of wages.&nbsp; The men declined the offer

not send work into the country.&nbsp; During the remaining

desirable that Norwich be made a port through Yarmouth, and
requested the Haven and Pier Commissioners to continue
negociations with the Norwich Joint Stock Company.&mdash;At the
adjourned meeting on September 5th the negociations fell through
owing to the strong opposition manifested by the traders and
merchants of Yarmouth.&nbsp; The Navigation Company, on September
29th, decided to revive the Lowestoft scheme, to execute the work
for a sum not exceeding &pound;100,000, and to apply for a Bill
in the next Session of Parliament.&nbsp; On November 22nd a
petition was presented in the House of Commons for leave to bring

Guardians the great body of the payers of the poor-rates are
entirely unrepresented, that the extraordinary increase in the

Russia, who landed at Yarmouth, with whom we had some
conversation on the subject of the free admission of foreign corn
into this country, gave it as his opinion that the fears
entertained here by the landed interest of excessive
importations, at least for some time to come, are quite
groundless.&nbsp; He admitted, however, that in eight or ten
years, from the encouragement we shall have given to the foreign
grower by our free trade system, if it should be extended to
corn, abundant supplies may be expected.&nbsp; What will
<i>then</i> be the state of the agriculture of <i>this</i>
country by no means too flourishing <i>now</i> may be easily
imagined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2.*&mdash;[Advt.]&nbsp; &ldquo;Whereas a report was very
generally circulated last week, and in a great measure obtained
credit, that the body of William Tounshend, which was buried at
Lakenham, on Sunday, November 19th, had been disinterred and
taken away, we, the undersigned, have investigated the matter and
certify the following statement to be correct:&mdash;The
relatives of the deceased being much affected at such a report
and naturally anxious to ascertain the truth of it, made
application to have the grave examined.&nbsp; After due
deliberation upon the subject permission was granted for that
purpose.&nbsp; The grave was opened on Saturday last in the
presence of them, together with us, when it was discovered that
the body reposed in its peaceful abode undisturbed.&nbsp; We
consider it to be our duty to give this public contradiction to
so groundless and scandalous a report, in order thereby to
satisfy the minds of the parishioners and the public at
large.&mdash;George Carter, vicar; Hunton Jackson, William
Norman, churchwardens; Lakenham Vestry, November 26th.&rdquo;</p>

Recorder of three Corporations, namely, Norwich, Yarmouth, and

faithful old servant by the hand.&nbsp; Lady Anne Coke, Lady

kindness and attention to the venerable and much-respected old
man.&rdquo;</p>

the conduct of business was discussed.&nbsp; Several magistrates

at the close of each meeting, and &ldquo;such of them as appeared
advisable be advertised in the newspapers.&rdquo;</p>

nominated for the office of City Chamberlain at Norwich, of whom
Mr. James Goodwin had the majority in the Court of Aldermen and
Mr. Beckwith in the Common Council.&nbsp; The assembly broke up
without electing the Chamberlain.&nbsp; On January 29th a special
meeting of the Corporation was held in consequence of the Mayor
having received notice that a rule of the Court of King&rsquo;s
Bench would be applied for requiring them to shew cause why a
writ of <i>mandamus</i> should not issue commanding them to admit
and swear Mr. Goodwin into the office of Chamberlain and other
offices.&nbsp; It was ordered that cause be shown.&nbsp; On

Goodwin was then proposed, and elected to the office.&nbsp; At a
Council meeting on June 7th, Mr. Beckwith took his seat as
Chamberlain, and was asked to retire; he refused, and the beadle
was called in.&nbsp; Mr. Beckwith, addressing that officer, said,
&ldquo;I give you notice, if you lay your hands on me you do so
at your peril.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the members remarked that if
the beadle did not turn him out they would.&nbsp; Mr. Beckwith
was then led out by the beadle, and the incident terminated.</p>

<p>9.&mdash;Died Adam Burrell, many years carrier between
Flitcham and Lynn.&nbsp; &ldquo;The deceased was rather an
eccentric character, and often designated as &lsquo;Adam

however, a very honest and inoffensive man.&rdquo;</p>

April hoax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&mdash;The annual election of Common Councilmen commenced at
Norwich.&nbsp; &ldquo;For several years &lsquo;cleansing
week&rsquo; has passed off without any serious contests, and the
&lsquo;Purple and Orange&rsquo; party has held uninterrupted
ascendency in three of the great wards since 1820.&nbsp; All at
once, however, the &lsquo;Blue and Whites&rsquo; have roused
themselves from their inaction, and again entering the field of
party warfare, have succeeded in displacing their
opponents.&nbsp; It is useless to deny that the week&rsquo;s
proceedings have been marked by undisguised bribery and
corruption, and that the object of the triumphant party has
mainly been achieved by superior weight of metal&mdash;by dint of
money.&rdquo;</p>

Marquis of Cholmondeley, of Houghton Hall, Lord Steward of his
Majesty&rsquo;s Household, &amp;c.</p>

&ldquo;He was in the commercial establishment of Messrs. Ives for
nearly 70 years and was justly esteemed in nautical and musical
communities.&nbsp; To the last his song was cheerful and his
convivial good humour unabated, and many a head must lie as low
as his before the name of &lsquo;Admiral&rsquo; Clark will be
forgotten, or his memory ceased to be cherished with
respect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>24.&mdash;The bounds of St. Peter Mancroft, Norwich, were
perambulated.&nbsp; &ldquo;It gave rise to those scenes of vulgar
mirth for which occasions of this kind are used as an excuse for
indulging in with impunity.&nbsp; We never remember the ducking
system carried to such lengths.&nbsp; The Rev. J. Bowman, in the
early stage of the proceedings, was on Hay Hill drenched from
head to foot.&nbsp; The pail which a fellow had in his hand (and

<p>12.&mdash;A serious riot occurred at Norwich.&nbsp; A party of
Wymondham weavers, who had damaged looms and destroyed silk to
the value of &pound;1,000, at Ashwellthorpe, had been conveyed to
Norwich Castle for examination.&nbsp; The witnesses were brought
to the city in hackney coaches, escorted by a detachment of the
12th Lancers.&nbsp; The Norwich weavers, who had barricaded the
Golden Ball Lane entrance to Castle Meadow with a waggon, and
placed a similar obstruction near the Castle Bridge, received the
military with a volley of stones.&nbsp; The witnesses were then
conveyed by way of Timberhill to Orford Hill, and while a large
body of special constables displaced the waggon at the bridge, a
second detachment of Lancers came from the Barracks, charged the
mob at full gallop, and dispersed them in all directions.&nbsp;
An attempted rally was frustrated by a second charge.&nbsp; The
Militia staff were under arms on the Castle Hill, and the streets
were patrolled by the Norwich light Horse Volunteers.&nbsp; At
the Norwich Assizes, on August 11th, several of the rioters were
indicted before Mr. Baron <!-- page 268--><a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>Garrow for
assaults, and were discharged on entering into their
recognisances.&nbsp; David Seeker, Henry Rix, and William
Thurston were charged with the capital offence of riotously
assembling together to the disturbance of the public peace.&nbsp;
Mr. Cooper, for the defence, objected to the wording of the
indictment.&nbsp; The words of the King&rsquo;s proclamation read
at the time of the disturbance were &ldquo;chargeth and
commandeth all persons,&rdquo; &amp;c.; the indictment said
&ldquo;chargeth and command&rdquo;; and instead of directing the
people to &ldquo;depart to their lawful habitations <i>or</i> to
their lawful homes,&rdquo; the indictment said &ldquo;<i>and</i>
to their lawful homes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The learned Judge pronounced
the objection to be valid, and expressed the hope that the
prisoners &ldquo;would go home sensible of the blessings of
Providence in having shielded them that day, and saved them from
an ignominious death.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Ashwellthorpe rioters were
bound over in the sum of &pound;50 each.</p>

<h4>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;A duel took place on Yarmouth Denes &ldquo;between
J--- B---, Esq., and W. M---, Esq., in consequence of a dispute
the previous day at the Bath Rooms.&nbsp; Both were to fire at
the same time, but on the signal being given Mr. M.&rsquo;s ball
did not take effect, and Mr. B.&rsquo;s pistol missed fire.&nbsp;
The seconds then interfered, and the affair was adjusted without
much difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6.&mdash;Norwich Theatre was re-opened for the Assize
week.&nbsp; &ldquo;The return of Mr. Osbaldiston gave rise to
scenes of disturbance which <!-- page 269--><a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>interrupted
the progress of the performance for several evenings.&nbsp; A
kind of set appears to have been made against him, but he has
been warmly applauded by the respectable part of the
audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6.&mdash;The Norfolk Cricket Club played the first of a series
of matches which took place during the Norwich Assize week.&nbsp;

Countess of Albemarle, Lady Anne Coke, Lady Stafford, Lady
Suffield, the Hon. Mrs. Wodehouse, Lady Lacon, and Mrs.
Gurdon.&nbsp; &ldquo;The waltz was introduced for the first time
in the course of the evening, but a very select few appeared
inclined to join in that rotatory movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>28.&mdash;The election of freemen&rsquo;s Sheriff took place
at Norwich; the candidates were Alderman T. O. Springfield and
Lieut. Fred White, R.N.&nbsp; &ldquo;As soon as the polling
commenced, a ticket was given by the &lsquo;Blue and White&rsquo;
party, entitling the voter who chose to accept it to
half-a-crown.&nbsp; Nothing was given on the side of the
&lsquo;Purple and Orange,&rsquo; Lieut. White having merely come
forward in consequence of a requisition sent to him by the poor
freemen and signed by upwards of 300 names.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poll
was thus declared: Springfield, 1,210; White, 474.&nbsp; Lieut.
White, in his subsequent address, wrote: &ldquo;I consider my
failure more honourable than to have gained the day by bribery
and corruption.&nbsp; The 474 votes I obtained will at least
rescue the character of a considerable portion of our
fellow-citizens from the reproach of selling themselves to the
highest bidder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>5.&mdash;The first stone of the new Roman Catholic chapel in
St. Giles&rsquo; parish, Norwich, was laid by the Hon. and Rev.
Edward Clifford.</p>

caused by the death of Mr. Herring took place at Norwich.&nbsp;

excitement prevailed throughout the contest.&nbsp; &ldquo;The

of the day that some of their friends had been carried off and
were detained in a warehouse in St. Clement&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A
magistrates&rsquo; warrant was applied for and the captives set
at liberty.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the close of the day the voting stood
as follows: Angell, 215; Marshall, 195.&nbsp; The friends of the
latter demanded that the poll be continued on the 13th,
&ldquo;because seven of Mr. Marshall&rsquo;s friends were
detained at Ranworth against their will.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other
side retaliated that eleven of their voters had been forcibly
carried away by the &ldquo;Blue and Whites.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Mayor deprecated the system that had been put in force, and
adjourned the poll till 10 o&rsquo;clock the following
morning.&nbsp; The poll was finally declared as follows: Angell,
218; Marshall, 196.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> September 24th.)</p>

Wroxham Castle public-house, the next morning removed to Horning
Swan, afterwards taken to Smallburgh, and on the same night
removed to Ridlington Plough.&nbsp; They wanted nothing for
eating and drinking, but Bailey being very ill, suffered very
much from being moved about.&rdquo;&nbsp; On his return to
Norwich he was engaged to sell programmes at the Musical
Festival, where he was in attendance from the 18th to the
20th.&nbsp; On the 22nd he broke a blood vessel and died.&nbsp;

captors, and the jury returned a verdict of &lsquo;Died from the

Haydn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Surprise Sinfonia,&rdquo; and the
<i>artistes</i> engaged included M. Venna, Master Sporle, Madame
Baur, and Mr. Barron.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gentlemen amateurs&rdquo; sang
glees, and at the close of the concert a ball took place, at
which 200 were present.</p>

churchyard by a party of grave watchers.&nbsp; He was in the act
of disinterring the body of one James Howlett, who was
accidentally killed a few days previously.&nbsp; The
resurrectionist, although badly wounded, effected his escape in
the darkness.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;Norwich Theatre opened for the season with Mr. Smith
as manager and lessee.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;Died, Mr. Martin Fountain, who was Sheriff of
Norwich in 1812.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;Atkins&rsquo; Menagerie was exhibited on the Castle
Hill, Norwich.</p>
<p>31.&mdash;Lord William Bentinck addressed a circular letter to
his constituents at Lynn, announcing his resignation as one of
the members for the borough, in consequence of his appointment as
Governor-General of India.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>4.&mdash;Lord George Bentinck was elected without opposition a
member for King&rsquo;s Lynn.&nbsp; &ldquo;No colours were worn,
agreeable to the regulations of Lord John Russell&rsquo;s most
sapient Act, and for which the ribbon-makers must feel highly
indebted to him in depriving them of a source of consumption for
an important branch of British manufacture of no inconsiderable
extent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.&mdash;At a meeting of the Norwich Court of Guardians, a
report was adopted in favour of altering the mulcts of the
assessable property in each of the parishes and hamlets of the
city.&nbsp; In the parishes the old valuation was &pound;61,302;
the new, &pound;89,080; increase, &pound;27,778&mdash;45 per
cent.&nbsp; In the hamlets the old valuation was &pound;19,722;
the new, &pound;21,487; increase, &pound;1,765&mdash;about 9 per
cent.&nbsp; At the vestry meetings in several parishes the new
assessment was rejected&mdash;(1) on the ground of increased
local and public burdens to which the citizens would be exposed
by increased rent on such valuation; and (2) because of the
disproportion of the assessment of the hamlets as compared with
the assessment of the city at large.&nbsp; At a meeting of the
Guardians on April 1st, a resolution was adopted declaring the
mulct to be unequal, and advising that steps be taken to place it
upon a fair and equitable basis.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;A &ldquo;trial of speed&rdquo; took place between the
Westacre and Melton Constable hounds.&nbsp; &ldquo;A noble stag
stood before the hounds an hour and ten minutes, but from the
numerous field, amounting at least to 400, the greater part of
whom were shamefully riding the roads and heading the stag at
every point, the sport was not brilliant.&nbsp; Through the
greater part of the day the Westacre hounds took the lead,
carried the best head, and did all the work; but from the
jockeyship of Sir Jacob Astley&rsquo;s huntsman in continually
lifting his hounds, and numerous horsemen pressing on them in the
lanes and woods, so completely frightened the Westacre hounds,
which are more timid and less accustomed to such crowds than the
Melton, that most of them were thrown out and could not again
recover their ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; The match took place in the
neighbourhood of East Dereham.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;In the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, Sir James
Scarlett moved for a rule to show cause why a <i>quo warranto</i>
information should not be filed <!-- page 274--><a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>against Mr.
Angell, of Norwich, for exercising the office of alderman without
being properly elected thereto.&nbsp; &ldquo;A very ancient
custom,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;prevailed at Norwich on the
election of aldermen, which he was sure would not, from its
antiquity, receive their lordships&rsquo; sanction.&nbsp; It was
called the cooping of voters, and consisted of taking the voters
by force in a body, bribing them, giving them drink, and keeping
them locked up until they consented to vote for the party on
whose side they had been taken.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was alleged that
several of the supporters of Mr. Angell&rsquo;s opponent (Mr.
Marshall) were waylaid, carried away by force in a coach, put on
board a boat on the broads, and had persons placed over them as
guards.&nbsp; If these persons had had their liberty, Mr.
Marshall, it was contended, would have been elected.&nbsp; Lord
Tenterden granted a rule to show cause.&nbsp; It was abandoned,
however, on April 28th, and &ldquo;the bells of St. Peter rang a
triumphant peal on the result being known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>13.&mdash;A squadron of the 6th Dragoons arrived at Norwich
Barracks, to replace the dep&ocirc;t of the 12th Lancers.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;A man named Bailey did penance in the chancel of
Yarmouth parish church for applying an opprobrious epithet to a
Mrs. Jenner.&nbsp; &ldquo;It being a very great novelty, there
was a large assemblage of persons to witness the performance of
the ceremony and to hear Bailey repeat his recantations, which
continued for some time, but he did <i>not</i>, as generally
supposed, stand in a white sheet.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;The election of a County Coroner took place at
Norwich, consequent upon the resignation of Mr. C.
Bringloe.&nbsp; Mr. E. Press, of Hingham, the successful
candidate, polled 1,073 votes, as against 766 obtained by his
opponent, Mr. Henry Hobart, Norwich.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;Died at his house in Surrey Street, Norwich, aged
68, Sir James Edward Smith, M.D., F.R.S., President of the
Linn&aelig;an Society.&nbsp; He was born in Norwich December 2nd,
1759, proceeded to Edinburgh University in 1780, and completed
his medical studies in London.&nbsp; In 1792 he had the honour of
instructing her Majesty the Queen and the Royal Princesses in
botany at Windsor.&nbsp; He married, in 1796, a daughter of Mr.
Robert Reeve, of Lowestoft, and in 1810 received the distinction
of knighthood.&nbsp; He was the author of &ldquo;English
Botany,&rdquo; and other works.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Mr. Macready appeared at Norwich Theatre in the part
of Virginius.&nbsp; On subsequent evenings he performed the
characters of Macbeth and William Tell.</p>
<p>22.*&mdash;&ldquo;Died at Canton, in China, by falling
overboard, Henry, son of Mr. Alderman Thurtell, of Norwich,
master-at-arms of the Atlas Indiaman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;*&ldquo;Died at Yarmouth, Mr. David Service, aged 52,
the well-known author of the &lsquo;Caledonian Herd-boy&rsquo;
and many other poetical productions of considerable
merit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>24.&mdash;The ward elections commenced at Norwich on this
date.&nbsp; &ldquo;Five shillings a man had been given on each
side from the commencement; but about eleven o&rsquo;clock a
placard was put out from the window of the <!-- page 275--><a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>&lsquo;Blue
and White&rsquo; (the Reformers&rsquo;) room, bearing the words,
&lsquo;The Blues pay gold.&rsquo;&nbsp; This alteration in the
market was followed, about an hour afterwards, by a similar
declaration from the &lsquo;Orange and Purples.&rsquo;&nbsp; From
this moment stock looked up; the price for the freemen altered
from five shillings to half a sovereign, and a whole sovereign,
and so on to sums of which we are not prepared to limit the
extent.&nbsp; A whole club, consisting of 20 members, calling
themselves &lsquo;the Independent Club,&rsquo; was purchased in
the lump by one of the &lsquo;Blue and White&rsquo;
candidates.&nbsp; The price first demanded was 5 guineas a man,
but others allow they were knocked down at the price of 50
gs.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;Died, aged 106, Thomas Scrape.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was
the father of Mrs. Lovell, of the Lobster Inn, St. John
Maddermerket, Norwich, and was born at Stalham in 1722, in the
9th year of the reign of George I.&nbsp; He had been often heard
to speak of remembering as a child the illuminations on the
occasion of the accession of George II.&nbsp; At the age of 105
this extraordinary old man presided at a large convivial party at
his residence.&nbsp; His pipe was his constant companion, and he
was often to be seen smoking and enjoying it at his
daughter&rsquo;s house, where his latter days were rendered
comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&mdash;Tombland Fair, Norwich, was ushered in by a severe
snowstorm.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Banisters, the Samwells, the
Chipperfields, the Adamses, and a host of other ornaments of the
vagrant stage for daylight gauds and the practical wit of
buffoons displayed themselves in imposing array.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
only &ldquo;rational&rdquo; exhibition at the fair was
Atkins&rsquo; Menagerie.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;A vessel, named the Lord William Bentinck, was
launched from the shipyard of Mr. Frederick Preston, at
Yarmouth.&nbsp; She was nearly 500 tons burden, and the largest
ship, with one exception, ever built at the port.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Ching Lau Lauro, &ldquo;the celebrated posture master
and buffo from Drury Lane,&rdquo; appeared at Norwich
Theatre.&nbsp; On the 10th he performed in a harlequinade,
entitled, &ldquo;The Man in the Moon.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No
viler tissue of nonsensical stuff could be foisted on the
patience of an insulted audience.&nbsp; It had more revolting
coarseness, and infinitely less ingenuity than ever characterised
the worst puppet shows&rsquo; clumsiest performers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Harlequin in the Shades&rsquo; descended to the lowest
vault of the Capulets, amidst universal hisses which such
execrable trash deservedly called forth, in spite of Ching Lau
Lauro swallowing his own head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>19.&mdash;The Norfolk County Cricket Club announced the
completion of a new cricket ground at East Dereham, described as
one of the best in the provinces.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;A remarkable whirlwind occurred at Gresham.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It came suddenly as in a moment from the south-west,
accompanied by a roar like thunder, and taking a north-easterly
direction towards Cromer, spent itself at sea.&nbsp; The extreme
force of the whirlwind lasted scarcely three minutes, but in that
time it completely ruined one William Watts, by rending the sails
and stocks from his mill, lifting the whole fabric from off the
post, and crushing the beams and inside works to pieces, together
with the roof and walls of the round-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>27.&mdash;Died at his house, Vauxhall, Lambeth, Mr.
Thomas H. Hull, aged 74, &ldquo;a gentleman well-known in Norwich
and Norfolk for a great number of years, and where many of his
beautifully-executed pictures remain as specimens of his superior
talent in the miniature department of portrait
painting.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;Mr. Angell and Mr. Patteson were nominated for the
Mayoralty of Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. W. Wilde nominated Mr. Alderman
Thurtell, the senior alderman below the chair; and Mr. Alderman
Yallop was also proposed.&nbsp; A poll was demanded, and the
result was declared as follows: Thurtell, 1,144; Yallop, 1,148;
Angell, 1,042; Patteson, 979.&nbsp; Application was made by
Messrs. Angell and Patteson for the reopening of the books on the
following morning, when the voting was: Thurtell, 1,210; Yallop,
1,212; Angell, 1,097; Patteson, 1,020.&nbsp; The Court of
Aldermen subsequently elected Mr. Thurtell.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;A public meeting was held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall,
Norwich, under the presidency of the Mayor (Mr. Finch), at which
resolutions were passed affirming that it was objectionable to
continue bounties on the export of sugar and prohibitory duties
on the produce of Colonial free labour, by which slavery was
supported at the expense of the British public.&nbsp; It was also
decided to petition Parliament to repeal such bounties and
duties, and to take measures to ensure the immediate alleviation
and the ultimate extinction of British Colonial slavery.&nbsp;
The petition, which was signed by 10,125 persons, measured 150
feet in length, and was presented in the House of Commons by Mr.
William Smith.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;A new theatre was opened at North Walsham by Mr.
Fisher, with the performance of the comic opera,
&ldquo;Sweethearts and Wives,&rdquo; and the musical farce of
&ldquo;The Turnpike Gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>8.&mdash;Died at Tittleshall, Mr. Thomas Riches, farmer, aged
69.&nbsp; &ldquo;In his early life he for many years, by being
pressed from Lynn, served his country at sea, and was in many
distinguished actions.&nbsp; He was at Gibraltar, at the
Chesapeak with Hood, in the same ship with our present Lord High
Admiral, then a boy; and was in the Formidable (flagship) with
Sir George, afterwards Lord Rodney, in the memorable battle of
1782, when M. De Grasse was taken.&nbsp; On his discharge and his
return to his native county, he embraced farming for a
livelihood, and always retained many of the peculiarities and
superstitions of a sailor&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>27.&mdash;The first seaborne vessel from London to Norwich
port direct, the Thames steam packet, Capt. John Morley, arrived
at Carrow Bridge.&nbsp; She was of 120 tons burden, 82 feet in
length, and handsomely fitted up for the accommodation of
passengers.&nbsp; The duration of her voyage was 28 hours.</p>
<p>&mdash;The Norwich Corporation decided to rebuild Fye Bridge
of iron, in accordance with the plans of Mr. Stone.&nbsp; The
foundation-stone of the new bridge was laid by the Mayor (Mr.
Thurtell) on June 2nd, 1829.</p>
<h4><!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>JUNE.</h4>
<p>9.&mdash;Mr. Kean, jun., made his first appearance at Norwich
Theatre in the character of Romeo.&nbsp; During his engagement he
appeared also as Jaffier (&ldquo;Venice Preserved&rdquo;) and
Felix (&ldquo;Hunter of the Alps&rdquo;).&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
difficult, indeed, to imagine,&rdquo; says the critic,
&ldquo;what besides an irresistible <i>penchant</i> for the stage
and an hereditary attachment for the most elevated dramatic work,
could have induced this gentleman to choose the profession of a
tragedian.&nbsp; Of a stature rather below the middle size, and
with a countenance that forms no index of the heroic mind, the
younger Kean seems studious of displaying all those peculiarities
of attitude, action, and intonation which we have been accustomed
to regard rather as defects than as excellencies in his justly
celebrated father.&nbsp; The genius of the elder Kean does not
shine forth in his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;A prize-fight took place between Warren and Cocks,
light weights, for &pound;50 a side.&nbsp; The gathering, which
was at Mattishall, was attended by many of the principal gentry
in the county, and by several members of the London ring,
including Phil Sampson (conqueror of Big Brown), Dick Curtis, Tom
Oliver, Frank Redmond, Ned Stockman, and Frosty-Faced Fogo,
&ldquo;the Poet Laureate of the Ring.&rdquo;&nbsp; The combatants
met in a meadow belonging to Mr. Petchell, but a magistrate
interfered, and a move was made to Elsing Common, where the fight
was brought off.&nbsp; Cocks was attended by Ned Painter and Ben
Gale, and Warren by Curtis and Redmond.&nbsp; Forty-one rounds
were fought in 56 minutes.&nbsp; Cocks, who won, threw his man 23
times in the first 25 rounds.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;Guild Day was celebrated in Norwich.&nbsp; Mr.
Alderman Thurtell, on being sworn in as Mayor, stated that he
stood in rotation for the office in 1818, and to his utter
astonishment the late Mr. Back was put in nomination and
elected.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thank God,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I have
had nerve enough to break all connection with a set of men who
have acted with so much duplicity and injustice towards
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Guild feast at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall was
attended by 460 guests.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;Died, Captain John Murray Browne, of the 75th
Regiment, aged 36, only son of the Rev. M. Browne, Minor Canon of
Norwich Cathedral, and grandson of Dr. John Murray.&nbsp; Capt.
Browne, who was drowned while fishing on a Lake near Mullingar,
had been in the Army from his youth, and served throughout the
Peninsular War.&nbsp; He was the author of a work entitled,
&ldquo;The State of Portugal, by an eyewitness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&mdash;Died at Hingham, suddenly, Charles Alexander, aged
23, &ldquo;an excellent cricketer, and the fastest length bowler
in the county.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>JULY.</h4>
<p>4.&mdash;A severe storm occurred in the Dereham, Fakenham, and
Cromer districts.&nbsp; Unsettled weather prevailed until the
13th, when the lower parts of Norwich and the meadows and marshes
above and below the city were flooded.&nbsp; Much meadow hay was
swept away, and the grain crops beaten down.</p>
<p><!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>8.&mdash;Twenty-three mackerel luggers contested for a
subscription purse of &pound;100, at Yarmouth.&nbsp; The race,
which took place in the Roads, was won by the Brothers (Capt.
John Ayres), owned by Messrs. R. and B. Fenn.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;An inter-county cricket match, Norfolk <i>v.</i>
Lincolnshire, was commenced at East Dereham.&nbsp; Scores:
Lincoln, 110; Norfolk, 74-30.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the
first day&rsquo;s play, a dinner, presided over by Lord Suffield,
and attended by eighty-six ladies and gentlemen, was given at the
Assembly Rooms; and on the 10th a grand ball took place in the
evening.</p>

M.P., gave notice that at the ensuing October Sessions he would
move &ldquo;that reporters for the newspapers be admitted into
the Grand Jury Chamber when the magistrates assemble there at
Quarter Sessions for the despatch of the business of the
county.&rdquo;&nbsp; The motion was discussed on October 17th,
when, after three hours&rsquo; debate, the Court divided, with
the following result: For the motion, 46; against, 45.</p>

<h4>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>4.&mdash;Died at the Deanery, in his 83rd year, the Very Rev.
James Turner, D.D., F.S.A., Dean of Norwich, Master of Pembroke
Hall, Cambridge, and rector of Sudbourne and Orford,

1790.&nbsp; His remains were interred in the Cathedral on August
12th.&nbsp; Dean Turner was succeeded by the Hon. and Rev. George
Pellew, Prebendary of Canterbury and of York, and third son of

<p><!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>11.&mdash;A libel action, Maitland <i>v.</i>
Kinnebrook, was tried at the Norwich Assizes, before Lord Chief
Baron Alexander.&nbsp; The plaintiff was an attorney living at
North Walsham, and the defendant one of the proprietors of the
&ldquo;Norwich Mercury.&rdquo;&nbsp; The libel, which the
defendant admitted, was contained in a letter published in the
&ldquo;Mercury.&rdquo;&nbsp; The plaintiff had provoked and
carried on a newspaper correspondence, and because the defendant
published the replies of adversaries of the plaintiff&rsquo;s own
creation, the plaintiff sued him for damages, which the jury
assessed at one farthing.</p>
<p>&mdash;Exchange Street, Norwich, was first opened to the
public.&nbsp; There was no communication, however, with St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Street, and it was not until April, 1829, that
operations were commenced for the removal of the old buildings at
the north end of the new thoroughfare.&nbsp; That portion of the
street was opened to the public on May 21st, 1832; and public
business was for the first time transacted in the Post Office
erected there, on June 25th, 1832.</p>
<p>&mdash;The members of the Norfolk and Suffolk Institution, the

<p>29.&mdash;The ceremony of swearing in the Sheriffs of Norwich
was performed at the Guildhall, amid a scene of great
disorder.&nbsp; The windows of the lower court had been screwed
down, to prevent persons entering by that way before the arrival
of the magistrates.&nbsp; The court was crowded, the heat
intolerable, and the Mayor (Mr. Thurtell) ordered the windows to
be broken.&nbsp; Upon the Sheriffs-elect, Mr. Stevenson and Mr.
Grout, presenting themselves, the latter was objected to, on the
ground that he was not a freeman; and Mr. Stevenson declined to
serve unless he received legal indemnity from his
colleague.&nbsp; The Recorder (Mr. Alderson) disposed of the
legal difficulty in Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s <!-- page 280--><a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>case, but
the uproar was so great that an adjournment had to be made to the
Aldermen&rsquo;s Chamber, where the Town Clerk administered the
oath to Mr. Grout, notwithstanding a protest by Col.
Harvey.&nbsp; At a meeting of the Common Council, on October 2nd,
a notice signed by eight of the &ldquo;Purple and Orange&rdquo;
Aldermen was read, intimating that any act done by the Council
would not be valid, as one of the Sheriffs was improperly
elected.&nbsp; They therefore declined to attend the
meeting.&nbsp; The Mayor complained that he was being set at
defiance, and threatened to appeal to a higher power.&nbsp; On
November 8th a motion was made in the Court of King&rsquo;s
Bench, to show cause why an information in the nature of a <i>quo
warranto</i> should not be filed against Mr. Grout, to show by
what authority he exercised the office of Sheriff; the Court
granted a rule <i>nisi</i>.&nbsp; On February 24th the
Corporation unanimously conferred on Mr. Grout the freedom of the
city.&nbsp; The case, after being several times before the Court,
was finally disposed of on June 28th, 1830, when Mr. Justice
Bailey delivered judgment, and said that the Court were of
opinion that it was essential to the validity of election to the
office of Sheriff that the individual chosen should be a
freeman.&nbsp; Judgment of ouster was therefore entered.&nbsp;
Retaliatory proceedings were taken in the Court of King&rsquo;s
Bench by the other political party against Mr. Alderman Patteson
for holding the office of Treasurer of the city, and against Mr.
Alderman T. S. Day, for acting as Corn Inspector.&nbsp; A rule
<i>nisi</i> was obtained against Mr. Patteson on May 30th, 1829,
and was made absolute on July 4th, after that gentleman had
resigned the treasurership.</p>

prevent manufacturers giving out work at reduced prices to
persons in the country.&nbsp; On September 1st the weavers
stopped the carriers&rsquo; carts and searched for country-made
goods.&nbsp; Men in disguise entered houses and took work from
the looms, under pretence that it had been done below the scale
prices.&nbsp; At a meeting at Ranelagh Gardens on October 5th,

Garrow, Ireland Watts and Robert Watts were charged on an
information filed by the Attorney-General, with obstructing
Custom-house officers in the discharge of their duty.&nbsp; Capt.
De Lafosse, the officer at Mundesley, traced contraband goods to
the house of the defendants at Antingham.&nbsp; Having obtained a
writ of assistance, he proceeded to the house with Lieut. Lee,
several of the coastguard, and a peace officer.&nbsp; Admittance
was demanded, and the defendants offered resistance.&nbsp; The
captain then drew his pistol and threatened to fire, when Robert
Watts bared his breast, exclaiming, &ldquo;Fire, and be
d---d.&rdquo;&nbsp; Capt. De Lafosse, fearing he could not enter
the house without bloodshed, withdrew his men.&nbsp; Mr. Kelly,
for the defence, submitted that the captain&rsquo;s authority did
not permit him to search the house, but the special jury returned
a verdict of guilty.&nbsp; In the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, in
November, Mr. Kelly moved for a rule to show why there should not
be a new trial, on the ground of the invalidity of the
officer&rsquo;s writ.&nbsp; Lord Tenterden held that this might
be a question of great importance on public grounds, although in
the individual case it was of little consequence.&nbsp; Rule
granted.&nbsp; (There is no further record of this case.)</p>
<p>14.&mdash;At the Norwich Assizes, before Mr. Justice Parke,

At the poll &ldquo;the partizans of Mr. Beare announced upon
their cards that they gave one shilling, but as soon as they
found that their opponents were giving 2s. 6d., they outbid the
&lsquo;Purples&rsquo; by offering 2s. 6d. and a pot of
beer.&nbsp; At three o&rsquo;clock the &lsquo;Purple and
Orange&rsquo; party headed their opponents by 64.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Blues&rsquo; went to work in purse and person, and placed
themselves in a majority.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Purples,&rsquo;
finding they could not regain the advantage, at 5.30 informed the
Mayor they did not wish to put their opponents to any further
expense.&nbsp; Beare, 1,200; Middleton, 1,023.&rdquo;</p>

was opened by the Right Rev. Dr. Weld, Bishop of
Amycl&oelig;.&nbsp; &ldquo;The ringing of the bells of St.
Giles&rsquo; church on the occasion has been made the subject of
a great deal more exultation on the one hand, and more
lamentation and indignation on the other, than it really
merits.&nbsp; The truth is that the bells were set out by the
ringers upon speculation, and they were afterwards handsomely
rewarded by the Catholics for their liberalism, the venality of
which is disgusting enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&mdash;The body of a woman, named Ann Coe, buried two days
previously, in Fincham churchyard, was disinterred and
stolen.&nbsp; &ldquo;The churchyard is <i>very near the turnpike

the greater part of the journey the keepers stood over them with

&ldquo;He was a man of rather eccentric habits.&nbsp; His
gravestone had been placed in the churchyard of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s nearly ten years before his death, having only a
blank for his age and day of decease.&nbsp; In his personal
habits he was frugal almost to parsimony, but his benevolence was
only bound by his means.&nbsp; He entirely rebuilt St.
James&rsquo;s almshouses for 12 widows, and an abode for the
Reader; and erected and partly endowed another almshouse (called

<p>5.&mdash;At the Norwich Consistory Court, the suit, Meachen
<i>v.</i> Carter, was tried.&nbsp; The parties lived at East
Dereham, and the dispute arose about the use of a pew in the
church.&nbsp; The defendant was proceeded against for
&ldquo;quarrelling, chiding, and brawling in church,&rdquo; and

in costs.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;During a severe storm from the N.N.E., the streets
of Cley-next-the-Sea were inundated in places to the depth of six
or eight feet, and several families were rescued from the upper

coast.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;The Relief Committee of the Norwich Court of
Guardians determined to erect two looms in the Workhouse for the
employment of persons who might apply for relief on the ground of
not being able to obtain work.&nbsp; From these looms, at a
subsequent date, work was deliberately cut and destroyed.&nbsp;
On the 12th the riotous conduct of the weavers necessitated the
calling out of the 7th Dragoon Guards; and on the 13th Mr. John
Wright, one of the principal master manufacturers, had vitriol
thrown into his face in St. Faith&rsquo;s Lane.&nbsp; Mr. Wright,
who was dreadfully injured, discharged a pistol at his assailant,
who escaped.&nbsp; The Corporation offered a reward for the
apprehension and conviction of the miscreant.&nbsp; Richard
Nockolds, who was executed for arson on April 9th, 1831,
confessed to the perpetration of the outrage.&nbsp; The distress
continued throughout the winter, and on February 6th a meeting
was held at the Guildhall, at which a relief fund was started,
and nearly &pound;3,000 raised.&nbsp; At the Norfolk Quarter
Sessions, on March 10th, Lord Suffield, in his charge to the
Grand Jury, suggested means for the alleviation of public
distress.&nbsp; Mr. Cobbett came down to Norwich and lectured at
Ranelagh Gardens on March 12th and 13th, on &ldquo;The State of
the Country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Half-a-crown admission was charged, and
&ldquo;he pocketed about &pound;50, which, all things considered,
was about as much as he could well expect.&rdquo;&nbsp; A common
hall was held on March 17th, &ldquo;to consider the unprecedently
distressed situation of the country,&rdquo; and Parliament was
petitioned on the subject.&nbsp; Mr. W. J. Utten Browne, in the
course of the proceedings, described Mr. Cobbett as &ldquo;one
whose name it was pollution to pronounce, and who had crawled up
from the very dregs of the people to a slimy
popularity.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the report of this meeting the term
&ldquo;Liberal,&rdquo; as used in a political sense, appeared for
the first time.&nbsp; On May 15th the welcome announcement was
made that some of the principal houses in Norwich had brought
gros de Naples and other silks to such a state of perfection that
they had a decided preference in the market, and that so numerous
were the orders that scarcely a loom in this important branch of
the weaving trade was unemployed.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;A great meeting of freeholders of the county was
held at the Shirehall, Norwich, presided over by the High Sheriff

Painter and Loveday, and the latter by Gale and Mike Fenn.&nbsp;

through the snow to witness this exhibition of
science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>19.&mdash;Mr. Marsham Elwin resigned the chairmanship of the

Bolingbroke, of Norwich.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;At three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, John Brooks
and William Brooks, awaiting trial in Norwich Castle for a
highway robbery at Middleton, attempted to escape.&nbsp; They
were confined in Bigod&rsquo;s Tower, from the summit of which
William Brooks endeavoured to lower himself by means of his
blanket and rug.&nbsp; The improvised rope gave way, and Brooks
fell a distance of 70 feet.&nbsp; His thigh, pelvis, left arm,
and the whole of the ribs on his left side were broken, and a
large tumour subsequently formed at the back of his head.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding his terrible injuries, Brooks recovered, and at
the Summer Assizes at Norwich was borne into court on the back of
a warder to take his trial.&nbsp; It was stated that he was
permanently crippled and quite disabled, but Mr. Justice Parke
sentenced him to transportation for life.</p>
<p>27.*&mdash;&ldquo;Private Flood, 7th Dragoon Guard&rsquo;s,
who was tried by court-martial for sleeping at his post at

had undergone, to remit the infliction of the
punishment.&rdquo;</p>

the Theatres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>20.*&mdash;&ldquo;We are informed that it is in contemplation
to establish a pack of foxhounds in the western part of Norfolk,
and that the kennel is to be at Litcham.&nbsp; In consequence
thereof, the largest of the Kempstone hounds will be disposed of,
but the Kempstone pack will not be given up.&nbsp; They will
return to their original standard of small beagles, which are
better adapted for elderly sportsmen, and will not hunt the same
day as the foxhounds do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>22.&mdash;A public meeting was held at Yarmouth, to protest
against the determination of his Majesty&rsquo;s Commissioners
for Building Churches to erect a church there in opposition to
the desire of the inhabitants.&nbsp; The imposition already in
force of 2s. in the pound on houses and grounds, and a duty of
2s. a chaldron on coals consumed in the town, for the support of
the church and chapel, was considered oppressive.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;The Common Council elections, which commenced at
Norwich on this date, gave the &lsquo;Orange and Purple&rsquo;
party the ascendancy.&nbsp; &ldquo;The trade in votes was
unblushingly pursued on both sides, and the prices that were
given towards the close of each day&rsquo;s polling were of a
heavy amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>30.&mdash;A steeplechase took place for a silver cup valued at
30 gs., from Fritton Church to Gorleston Church, a distance of

gentlemen of Mr. Munro&rsquo;s hunt dined at the Bear Inn, and

appropriate song, the production of Mr. Burton, of the Norwich
Theatre Royal, and repeated by that gentleman in the course of
the evening with increased effect.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;At a meeting held at the King&rsquo;s Arms Inn, East
Dereham, it was decided to establish a pack of foxhounds in that

<p>&mdash;*&ldquo;Last month a number of persons left North and
South Lopham in waggons, on their way to embark at Liverpool for
the United States of America.&nbsp; Between 100 and 200 persons
are emigrating from these parishes, a considerable sum of money

volunteered to form a jury to try the next cause.&nbsp; Those
sworn were Messrs. J. B. Daveney, H. Miller, G. Dye, R. Fickling,
C. S. Gilman, Colman, Lawter, and Marston.&nbsp; Three laymen
made up the requisite number.&nbsp; &ldquo;The swearing of the
jury of legal gentlemen caused much laughter, and what appeared
most singular, after hearing evidence on both sides, they could
not agree to a verdict, but recommended the withdrawal of a
juror, which was done accordingly.&nbsp; Such a jury was never
heard of before in Norwich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>10.&mdash;John Simmons, aged 31, and William Lovet, 20,
convicted at Thetford Assizes of burglaries at Thorpe, were
executed on the Castle Hill, Norwich.&nbsp; Calcraft was the

Commissioners, a report was received from the Lighting and
Watching Committee on the proposals of the agents of the Norwich
Gas-Light Company for extending their works through the principal
streets of the city.&nbsp; There were then four miles of main and
service pipes supplied with oil gas; it was proposed to extend
the pipes to twelve miles, and to supply &ldquo;purified coal
gas.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was explained that the adoption of the
proposal would result in the abolition of 900 old oil lamps and
the substitution of gas lamps, at an increased annual charge of
&pound;500.&nbsp; At an adjourned meeting on April 30th, the
scheme was adopted, and tenders were invited for carrying it into
effect.&nbsp; In May the Norwich Gas Company purchased five acres
of land near Bishop Bridge, on which to erect works for supplying

J. Utten Browne moved that a petition be presented to the House
of Lords against the Reform Bill, which he described as &ldquo;a
tissue of fraud, folly, and injustice, hideous in its anomalies,
and displaying more profound ignorance of sound constitutional
law than any other <!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>production he had ever
witnessed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The motion was adopted by 40 votes
against 9.&nbsp; An address to the King was circulated in Norwich

his Majesty in rejecting the pernicious and unconstitutional
counsel of Ministers completely to overwhelm the free
deliberations of the House of Peers by creating a large addition

honourable House.&rdquo;&nbsp; The address and signatures were

parchment.&nbsp; On the 14th a public meeting was held at St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, &ldquo;for the purpose of adopting such

Address&rdquo; to the King was circulated, acknowledging

<p>16.&mdash;The case of the King <i>v.</i> the Mayor and
Recorder of Thetford came before the Court of King&rsquo;s
Bench.&nbsp; The defendants were required to show why they should
not hold a weekly Court of Pleas at the Guildhall, according to
the charter of Queen Elizabeth, which directed that the Court
should proceed according to the rules and customs of a similar
Court at Norwich.&nbsp; It was objected that the affidavits did
not show the existence of the Norwich Court at the date of the
Thetford charter, but only that a certain Court of Pleas was
granted to that city by a charter of Charles II.&nbsp; On the
other side it was alleged that the Thetford Court had actually
been held within fifty years.&nbsp; Lord Tenterden: The charter
of Charles II. may have confirmed a previous grant.&nbsp; We
think the objection has been answered.&nbsp; The rule must be
absolute.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Robert Woodrow, gamekeeper to Col. Peel, was
summoned before the magistrates at Thetford for seizing the rods
of two persons fishing in the river of that town.&nbsp; It was
contended that Col. Peel merely hired the manor of Mr. A. Baring,
and that he could not show a right to the fishing, the river
being navigable, and, as such, <i>prima facie</i> public to the
inhabitants, who had immemorially enjoyed the right.&nbsp; The
magistrates decided to the contrary on both points, and dismissed
the complaint.</p>

Finsbury.&nbsp; On the 13th Lord Stormont and Sir James Scarlett
were adopted Conservative candidates, and on the 14th it was
announced that Mr. R. H. Gurney would have as his colleague Mr.
H. Bellenden Ker.&nbsp; A third candidate, Mr. William Eagle,
entered the field, but his principles were doubtful.&nbsp; At a
meeting held at the Bowling Green Inn, on August 7th, he stated
that he belonged to neither party, for &ldquo;he looked upon the
Tory as a highwayman and the Whig as a pickpocket.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Eagle retired before the nomination took place.&nbsp; The
Conservative candidates made their first public appearance <!--

<p>6.&mdash;George Borrow, writing to the <span
class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span> on this date, suggested
the derivation of the word &ldquo;Tory.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tory,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;is composed of three Irish
words, and doubtless originated amongst the Irish adherents of
Charles II. at the time they were suffering under the sway of
Cromwell and were sighing for the Restoration.&nbsp; The words
are Tar a Ri, and their pronunciation is the same as that of
&lsquo;Tory,&rsquo; or if there be any difference, it consists in
a scarcely distinguishable drawl.&nbsp; Their meaning is,
&lsquo;Come, O King.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;Died at East Dereham, aged 73, Mr. Fisher, many years
manager of the Norfolk and Suffolk Company of Comedians.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Fisher made his first appearance as an amateur at
Norwich Theatre, in the character of Lubin (&lsquo;The
Quaker&rsquo;).&nbsp; Mr. Barrett, who was then manager, was so
much gratified with the performance that he persuaded him to make
the stage his profession, and offered him a liberal engagement,
which he accepted, and remained with the company some
years.&nbsp; As manager of the Norfolk and Suffolk Company, he
raised it to a degree of respectability equal to any provincial
theatre in the kingdom.&nbsp; As a manager he was esteemed, and
by his indefatigable industry he has been enabled to leave his
sons eleven theatres, many of which have been recently built and
elegantly decorated.&nbsp; As an actor he displayed much
talent.&nbsp; He was an affectionate parent and warm friend, and
in the strictest sense an honest, just, and upright
man.&rdquo;</p>

was the &ldquo;Blue and White,&rdquo; and Mr. Alderman Steward
the &ldquo;Purple and Orange&rdquo; candidate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bribery to a vast amount was resorted to, and the last few
votes cost a heavy sum.&rdquo;&nbsp; Result: Foster, 1,282;

was commenced by the Mayor on September 8th.&nbsp; After an
enquiry lasting twelve days, Mr. Foster was declared elected.</p>

by court-martial for insubordination.&nbsp; He was sentenced to
receive 200 lashes, which were administered immediately, in the
presence of the whole regiment.&nbsp; All the men were armed with
their weapons, and carried ball cartridge.&nbsp; This action on
the part of the Colonel restored discipline and obedience to
orders.&nbsp; Each prisoner made a long written defence.&nbsp;
Their principal complaint was that the regiment was
overworked.&nbsp; Colonel Keane replied that what had been
ordered was by direction of the War Office; and the men had been
kept constantly employed in consequence of the prevalence of
cholera in Norwich.&nbsp; The court concluded its sittings on

J. Utten Browne and Mr. Edward Steward) declined to attend or to

process unknown to the law of England, and eminently hostile to
public liberty.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inquiry lasted twenty-two days,
and concluded on December 19th.</p>

conducted in the church on December 27th, by Mr. John Dalrymple,
of Norwich, in the presence of sixty scientific and medical

October 17th, it was decided to employ Mr. Blore, a well-known
architect and antiquary, &ldquo;to survey and report upon the

the repairs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Blore reported on November 10th
that the masonry was in a very bad state; that the then face of
the building was not altogether original, but that the repairs
and restorations it had undergone at various periods had been
closely assimilated with the original work.&nbsp; He recommended
that what was needed to be done should be judiciously
incorporated with the ancient work.&nbsp; It was finally decided,
on January 9th, 1835, that the visiting justices be authorised to
continue the work as originally intended, and that they be
empowered to consult Mr. Blore or any other architect they might
think proper to employ.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;At a meeting of the Norwich Corporation, a resolution
was passed protesting against any report that might be made by
the Municipal Commissioners respecting the Corporation,
&ldquo;based on statements so <!-- page 329--><a
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>utterly
unfit to justify Parliament in legislating on so important a
subject,&rdquo; and inviting the various Corporations throughout
the kingdom &ldquo;to make common cause with them in endeavouring
to defeat any design that might be in contemplation for wresting
from them their antient charters, franchises, and
liberties.&rdquo;</p>

Committee of the House of Commons, in reporting the election
void, passed a series of special resolutions to the effect that
John Pilgrim and others were guilty of bribery and of absconding
to avoid the Speaker&rsquo;s warrant; that Pilgrim, having at
length been served, was prevented attending the Committee by
being arrested on a charge of embezzlement, and that the conduct
of the magistrates before whom he was charged appeared to the
Committee to be a breach of the privileges of the House.&nbsp; On
June 29th it was moved that the committing magistrates be sent to
Newgate, but instead they were ordered to attend before the House
on July 3rd.&nbsp; That order was discharged, and the inquiry was
referred to the same Select Committee that was to investigate the
charges against Pilgrim&rsquo;s employers.&nbsp; At the Norwich
Assizes on August 8th, before Mr. Baron Bolland, the bill in the
case of embezzlement was respited to the next court.&nbsp; A
meeting of the Norwich Corporation was held on September 21st, at
which a vote of thanks was accorded to Mr. Bignold and Mr. Booth

Commons on the charge of alleged breach of privileges of the
House,&rdquo; and it was ordered that their expenses in London be
defrayed by the city.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> March 29th, 1836. )</p>

<p>26.&mdash;Petitions were presented from Yarmouth, complaining
that bribery had been practised at the election of members for

not complain of the return; and did not impute bribery to the
members or their agents.&nbsp; But it was alleged that two
guineas had been paid to many of the voters at the house of a
person who had been an active partisan of the sitting
members.&nbsp; The petitions were referred to a Committee of the
House.&nbsp; On July 30th the Chairman of the Committee reported
that Mr. Prentice, one of the witnesses, refused to answer
certain questions, on the ground that the answers would
incriminate himself.&nbsp; He was sent to Newgate on August
6th.&nbsp; On the same day the Chairman reported that three other
witnesses, Messrs. Preston, Lacon, and Green, had refused to
answer any questions at all.&nbsp; Mr. Preston was brought to the
bar and informed by the Speaker that the House had decided he was
bound to submit to be examined by the Committee without prejudice
to his right to object to any questions, the answers to which
might tend to criminate himself.&nbsp; Mr. Preston and Messrs.
Lacon and Green attended the Committee.&nbsp; They objected to
the very first question which at all tended to bear on the
matter, because, they said, the answers might criminate
them.&nbsp; The Committee agreed that the answers would have that
tendency, and discharged the witnesses from further
attendance.&nbsp; On August 11th Mr. Prentice was likewise
discharged from Newgate, and on his arrival at Yarmouth, on
August 14th, was welcomed by a <!-- page 342--><a
name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>large
crowd, who escorted his carriage through the town, with a band
playing.&nbsp; At the Norfolk Assizes, on March 31st, 1836,
before Mr. Justice Parke, Messrs. Preston, Green, and Lacon were
charged with the alleged acts of bribery, but each case was
disposed of without one of the persons against whom the charges
were preferred being required to enter upon any defence
whatever.</p>

Poor-law Commissioners that the allowances to the &ldquo;surplus

neighbouring villages.&nbsp; The houses of Mr. Ketton and Mr.

Petersburg to Liverpool, was lost, with her crew of eight hands,

encourage the abominable plunder here carried on.&rdquo;</p>

Peter Taylor was found guilty, as an accessary before the fact,
of the murder of Mary Taylor, his wife, at Burnham Westgate, on

innocence, was hanged on the Castle Hill, Norwich, on April
23rd.</p>
<p>&mdash;At the same Assizes, before Mr. Justice Gaselee, John

crime while poaching on the lands of Mr. W. L. Jones, at
Methwold.&nbsp; They were found guilty and sentenced to
death.&nbsp; The jury subsequently delivered to his lordship at
the Deanery the following declaration: &ldquo;Our opinion is that
the prisoners were guilty of manslaughter, not murder, and it was
our intention so to find had we not been called upon to give our
opinion as to the facts.&rdquo;&nbsp; The execution was deferred
for the opinion of the Judges assembled in the Court of
Exchequer.&nbsp; On April 23rd Lord Denman stated that the
Judges, after hearing counsel on both sides, were of opinion it
would not be proper to execute the prisoners for the crime of
murder.</p>

Rackham on the one part, and Mr. T. O. Springfield on the other
part, having been presented to the Lord Chancellor relative to
the composition of the trustees of the Norwich charities, the
matter was argued on this date before the Master in Chancery, who
ruled that in composing the list of trustees he would not admit
more than four Dissenters out of the 21; further, that in the
execution of their official duties, the trustees should be
divided into two classes, and that none but those who were
members of the Church of England should have a voice in the
presentation to any Church living.&nbsp; On December 23rd the
Master presented a draft report, stating the composition of the
&ldquo;Church list&rdquo; and of the &ldquo;general
list.&rdquo;&nbsp; The former contained eleven selected from the

<p>29.&mdash;A new fire escape, invented by the Rev. Mr. Arthy,
of Caistor near Norwich, was exhibited in front of the Union
Office, Surrey Street.&nbsp; &ldquo;It consists of a jointed
ladder, the first length 10 ft. and seven others 6 ft. 7 in.
long, with a pulley inserted in the head of the first length,
over which a chain passes, to one end of which a large basket is
attached, and two rollers are affixed to the under side of the
top length, to enable the ladder to pass freely over the
brickwork, and two ropes are attached to the outer sides of the
top, to guide the ladder in raising it, to bring it forward where
projections occur, and to keep it from slipping either way.&nbsp;
After the ladder is raised to the proper height, the ropes pass
under the basket to keep it steady in going up or down.&nbsp; The
machine is constructed on a small platform, mounted on wheels,
and can be conveyed with great rapidity to any given
point.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;Municipal elections were held for the first time on
this date, under the Municipal Reform Act.&nbsp; At Norwich the
contests in the eight wards resulted in the return of eight
Conservatives and eight Whig-Radicals.</p>
<p>&mdash;Died at King&rsquo;s Lynn, Mr. Joseph Waters, for many
years a prominent merchant in that town.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
melancholy event took place owing to a violent fright which he
received in the Theatre on that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&mdash;In the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench commenced a long
course of litigation in which the Corporation of Norwich was
concerned.&nbsp; Sir W. Follett applied for a rule to shew cause
why a <i>quo warranto</i> should not <!-- page 353--><a
name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 353</span>be filed
calling upon Mr. Thomas Brightwell to show by what authority he
claimed to exercise the office of Alderman.&nbsp; It was
explained that after the passing of the Municipal Reform Act a
certain number of Aldermen were elected for the city.&nbsp;
Instead of each being nominated separately, they were all
proposed and elected in a batch, which, it was contended, was
clearly illegal.&nbsp; The court granted the application.&nbsp; A
similar rule was applied for against the Mayor, Mr. Springfield,
for, it was argued, if the Aldermen had not themselves been
properly elected, they could not elect a Mayor.&nbsp; A rule was
also granted in this case.&nbsp; On November 24th the rule was
made absolute in the case of Mr. Brightwell, and enlarged in the
case of Mr. Springfield.&nbsp; In the Bail Court on the same date
Mr. Kelly obtained rules <i>nisi</i> calling upon fourteen
persons to show by what authority they took upon themselves to
act as Aldermen.&nbsp; On December 19th the Attorney-General
applied in the Rolls Court for an injunction to restrain the
Mayor and Corporation from defraying out of the municipal funds
the expenses incurred in defending the <i>quo warrantos</i> in
the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, calling upon Messrs. Springfield
and Brightwell to show cause by what authority they held the
offices, the former of Mayor and the latter of Alderman, as well
as the expenses attending the presentation of a petition to the
Lord Chancellor to appoint new trustees of the funds of the
public charities, the management of which was vested in the
Corporation.&nbsp; The bill charged the defendants with applying
the Corporation funds wrongfully, in a manner inconsistent with
the duties of a Mayor and Corporation, and in direct violation of
the provisions of the Municipal Corporation Act, by applying them
for the aforesaid purposes, in consequence of certain resolutions
to which the corporate body had come.&nbsp; The effect of these
resolutions was that the City Treasurer should from time to time
pay out of the city funds such sums of money as the committee of
the Corporation should deem necessary towards defraying the
expenses of the <i>quo warrantos</i> and petition
above-named.&nbsp; The defendants put in two demurrers to the
bill, and Lord Langdale said he would consider the case before
pronouncing judgment.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January 13th, 1837.)</p>
<p>5.*&mdash;&ldquo;We wish to direct the attention of landowners
and farmers in Norfolk to the extraordinary success which has
attended the attempt of Mr. R. Crawshay, of Honingham Hall, to
cultivate hops in Norfolk.&nbsp; A sample of them may now be seen
at Norgate and Co.&rsquo;s, which competent judges have declared
to surpass the growth of any other county in the kingdom.&nbsp;
Our agriculturists will be deeply indebted to this gentleman for
proving to them that a valuable plant indigenous to the soil may
be cultivated with profitable success in Norfolk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Mr. Thomas Brightwell was elected Mayor, and Mr. John
Bateman appointed Sheriff, of Norwich.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;A musical festival took place at Fakenham parish

morning, and &ldquo;Judas Maccabeus&rdquo; in the evening.&nbsp;
The soloists were supplied by the choir of Norwich
Cathedral.&nbsp; &ldquo;Admission, middle aisle, 3s.; other
parts, 2s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.*&mdash;&ldquo;The allotment system has been tried on a
tolerably large scale in the parish of Attleborough, by Sir John
Smyth, Bart., of Woodmarston Hall, Surrey, lord of the manor of
Attleborough.&nbsp; The allotments are let at moderate rents, not
exceeding the rent of similar <!-- page 354--><a
name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 354</span>lands in
farm, with the addition of the tithes and other charges which are
paid by the landlord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>28.&mdash;Sir James Flower&rsquo;s hounds met at Stow, where
the stag was turned off and was taken at Garboldisham Lings,
after a run of five hours.&nbsp; The distance from point to point
was about eleven miles, but the stag ran at least 40 miles, and
the only horsemen up at the finish were the huntsman and first
whip.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;A severe gale occurred.&nbsp; A large wooden
building erected at the Ranelagh Gardens, Norwich, for circus
performances, was blown down by the tremendous violence of the
wind.&nbsp; &ldquo;The great oak at Necton, for which the late
Mr. William Mason was offered by a shipwright at Lynn, in 1812,
120 guineas, had two arms blown off it, each the size of ordinary
timber trees.&rdquo;&nbsp; Barns and wheat stacks were blown down
at Necton, Ashill, West Bradenham, and Beeston.&nbsp; At
Carbrooke a windmill, the property of Mr. Robert Homes, was
wrecked, and his son killed.</p>
<p>&mdash;The Freebridge Lynn Hundred Association for the
encouragement of agricultural labourers and servants was formed
at a meeting held at the Duke&rsquo;s Head Inn, Lynn.&nbsp; Sir
W. B. ffolkes was elected president; the Rev. C. D. Brereton, of
Little Massingham, secretary; and Mr. B. Aldham, treasurer.</p>
<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;The directors of the Norwich Yarn Company having
obtained the minimum sum necessary for commencing their new works
on the ground purchased of Mr. Youngman, the first stone of the
new factory was laid on this day.&nbsp; The event was celebrated
by a procession in honour of Bishop Blaize, to illustrate the
pagan story of Jason&rsquo;s argonautic expedition to Colchis in
search of the Golden Fleece.&nbsp; The last celebration of the
kind took place in 1783.&nbsp; The character of Bishop Blaize was
impersonated &ldquo;most appropriately, both as to age and
gravity, by Richard Dickerson, comber, who had taken part in the
former procession.&rdquo;&nbsp; Starting from the premises of the
company, the procession paraded the principal streets of the
city, and halted opposite Mr. Bignold&rsquo;s house in Surrey
Street, where an &ldquo;oratorical address&rdquo; was delivered
by the senior orator, Edward Warman.&nbsp; At noon the procession
arrived at St. Edmund&rsquo;s, where Mr. Bignold laid the
foundation stone, and, in addressing the company, stated that the
building about to be erected would be 163 ft. in length, by 42
feet in width, and four storeys high.&nbsp; As the works already
in operation afforded employment to 800 people, this mill, which
would be one-third larger, would yield employment to 1,200.&nbsp;
Upwards of &pound;15,000 had been raised for defraying the cost
of the works.&nbsp; The procession afterwards moved by a
circuitous route to St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, where the directors
entertained 900 persons who had taken part in the
proceedings.&nbsp; John Sell Cotman, who had sketched the
pageant, announced the issue and sale of folio prints
illustrating the event.&nbsp; He stated: &ldquo;In pure regard of
the children of the industrious poor of my native city, I give my
labour, with the entire profits of the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>10.&mdash;The skeleton of a gigantic whale, taken at Plymouth
in October, 1831, was exhibited on the Castle Hill,
Norwich.&nbsp; It measured 85 feet in length, and was advertised
as &ldquo;The Prince of Whales at Home.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 355--><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>25.&mdash;Christmas Day was ushered in with snowstorms
and hailstorms, thunder, and lightning.&nbsp; On the 26th the
roads were rendered almost impassable by the drifting snow,
which, in some localities, was from ten to twelve feet
deep.&nbsp; Soon all vehicular traffic was stopped.&nbsp; The
Ipswich mail coach, which should have arrived at Norwich on
Christmas Day, did not reach the city until eleven o&rsquo;clock
on the night of the 29th.&nbsp; It was detained at Thwaite
Duke&rsquo;s Head, whence the letter bags were despatched in the
charge of mounted messengers.&nbsp; One of the passengers, Capt.
Petre, undertook to walk to Norwich, a distance of twenty-eight
miles; he arrived in the city on the 28th, and thence proceeded
on his journey to Westwick House.&nbsp; The Newmarket mail could
get no further than Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s, and all other public
vehicles were delayed.&nbsp; On the Dereham, Fakenham, and other
turnpikes gangs of labourers were employed to remove the
snowdrifts.&nbsp; There were many shipping casualties on the
Norfolk coast.&nbsp; Such severe weather had not been experienced
since 1799.&nbsp; The thaw commenced in the middle of January,
1837, and high floods occurred in the neighbourhood of Norwich
and in other localities.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;Ryan&rsquo;s Royal Circus was opened for the season
in a large wooden building erected at the Ranelagh Gardens,
Norwich, by Mr. Bunn.</p>
<h3>1837.</h3>
<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;Hannah Manfield (or Saddler), aged 50, a woman of
eccentric habits, residing on Denver Common, was found dead in
her cottage, with her throat cut.&nbsp; A considerable quantity
of plate had been taken from a cupboard, and a sum of money,
supposed to be nearly &pound;20, was also stolen.&nbsp; On the
14th Mr. Wright, a police-officer of Lynn, apprehended at
Doncaster John Smith, aged 25, John Varnhem, 23, and George
Timms, 22, who were committed for trial on the capital
charge.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> April 6th, 1837.)</p>
<p>5.&mdash;In consequence of a resolution passed at a special
meeting of the Town Council, the Mayor of Norwich convened a
meeting at the Guildhall on this date, &ldquo;to take into
consideration the sufferings of the poor in this inclement
season, and to adopt measures for relieving the
same.&rdquo;&nbsp; A public subscription was opened.&nbsp; At a
general meeting of the subscribers, on March 21st, Mr. W. G.
Edwards, one of the secretaries, reported that the amount
subscribed was &pound;2,008 7s. 3d., out of which a grant of
&pound;300 was made to the Sick Poor Society; 20,093 coal
tickets, and 37,831 bread tickets were distributed, and
&pound;423 3s. 5d. was placed in the treasurer&rsquo;s hands to
meet future emergencies.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Wombwell&rsquo;s Menagerie was exhibited on the
Castle Meadow, Norwich.&nbsp; The proprietor presented to the
Museum fine specimens of a lioness, boa constrictor, racoon, and
kangaroo.</p>
<p><!-- page 356--><a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>13.&mdash;In the Rolls Court, Lord Langdale gave
judgment in the action the Attorney-General <i>v.</i> the
Corporation of Norwich.&nbsp; He said that, as far as regarded
the <i>quo warrantos</i>, if a Corporation was not allowed to
defend an election duly made, the interests of corporations would
be hazarded in every case where a Mayor or other officer did not
chose to be at the expense of defending his own election against
a rule <i>nisi</i>.&nbsp; It was not a reasonable construction of
the new statute that corporations had no interests whatever in
the charitable trusts of boroughs.&nbsp; It was true that the
administration of charitable estates was distinct from the
administration of borough funds, and that neither a corporation
as a body nor any member thereof in his corporate capacity ought
to be trustees of such estates; still, a corporation, in
attending to the public benefits of the inhabitants of a borough,
had a due interest in the appointment of those trustees.&nbsp;
Under all the circumstances of the case, therefore, he was of
opinion that the demurrers must be allowed.&nbsp; At Norwich
Assizes on April 6th, before Mr. Justice Parke, the case Rex
<i>v.</i> Brightwell was tried by a special jury.&nbsp; This was
an information in the nature of a <i>quo warranto</i>, calling
upon the defendant to show by what authority he exercised the
office of Alderman.&nbsp; Mr. Andrews, for the defendant,
contended that if he was not a good Alderman he was not a good
Mayor; and if he had not been legally elected Alderman, then all
the other Aldermen who had been elected in the same way were
elected equally contrary to the law, and all the proceedings
which had taken place respecting the police and borough rates
would be bad, and the Corporation of the city entirely dissolved,
and nothing could cure the defect but a fresh Act of
Parliament.&nbsp; Mr. Kelly, for the Crown, urged that the law of
England had fixed from time immemorial that corporate officers
should not be elected in one batch, but that they must be
proposed and voted for separately, and that all elections
conducted in any other way were null and void.&nbsp; The jury
returned a verdict for the Crown.&nbsp; In the Court of
King&rsquo;s Bench, on April 19th, application was made to move a
rule to show cause why the verdict for the Crown could not be set
aside, on the ground that the election was perfectly fair, and
there was no pretence for saying that the wishes and intentions
of the electors had not been carried into effect.&nbsp; A rule
was granted.&nbsp; In the Court of Chancery, on May 6th, the case
assumed another phase.&nbsp; An information was filed against the
Corporation by Mr. Samuel Bignold, alleging that they intended to
divert their funds from corporate purposes by paying the expenses
incurred by the Town Clerk and other persons who had proceeded to
London to support a petition presented to the Lord Chancellor, in
order to secure the return of certain persons as trustees of the
charities hitherto vested in the old Corporation; and by paying
the expenses arising out of the proceedings by <i>quo
warranto</i> in the cases of Mr. Springfield and Mr.
Brightwell.&nbsp; The further hearing was adjourned till next
term.&nbsp; On May 22nd it was reported to the Court of
King&rsquo;s Bench that at a meeting of the Town Council on the
19th, an order was passed &ldquo;that &pound;1,000 be paid to the
Town Clerk on account of disbursements by him relative to law
proceedings,&rdquo; such law proceedings being the matter in
which the injunction had been applied for.&nbsp; The Lord
Chancellor, on the 24th, granted an order to restrain the payment
of the amount.&nbsp; The appeal from the decision of the Master
of the Rolls, allowing a demurrer on the information filed by Mr.
Bignold, came before the Court of Chancery on May 27th.&nbsp; The
Lord Chancellor, after adjournment, gave judgment on the demurrer
against the injunction, and confirmed the decision of the <!--
page 357--><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>Master of the Rolls, with costs.&nbsp; At a meeting of
the Town Council on June 2nd, Mr. Bignold expressed his intention
to carry the case to the House of Lords.</p>
<p>13.&mdash;Died at St. Gregory&rsquo;s, Norwich, aged 81, Mr.
William Lorkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was for 65 years a member of the
Wesleyan Methodist body, having joined them soon after Mr. Wesley
first visited Norwich.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1825 he published a work
entitled &ldquo;A concise history of the establishment of
Wesleyan Methodism in Norwich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>28.&mdash;The influenza epidemic at this date prevailed in
city and county, and cases occurred in almost every family.</p>
<p>&mdash;An omnibus &ldquo;upon the London plan&rdquo; commenced
running between Norwich and North Walsham.</p>
<p>&mdash;The Magnet coach, from the Swan and Rampant Horse Inns,
was advertised to do the journey from Norwich to London, through
Thetford and Newmarket, every night, in twelve hours.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The proprietors, in returning thanks for the very liberal
patronage bestowed on them, beg most respectfully to inform their
friends and the public that they have, at an additional expense,
fixed a light inside this coach, which, having given such
universal satisfaction, will be continued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>31.&mdash;At a meeting of the Conservative party at the
Norfolk Hotel, Norwich, held under the presidency of Col. Harvey,
the Marquis of Douro was asked to become a candidate for the
representation of the city, in place of Lord Viscount Stormont,
M.P., who had acceded to the request of the electors of his own
county, Perthshire, to offer himself as their candidate on the
dissolution of Parliament.&nbsp; The requisition to the Marquis
was signed by 1,600 of the electors of Norwich; his lordship
complied with the request and issued his address on February
13th.&nbsp; Lord Douro and the sitting member, the Hon. Robert
Campbell Scarlett, commenced a personal canvass of the city on
June 16th, and in the evening attended a meeting of the Orange
and Purple Club, at the Maid&rsquo;s Head Hotel, at which they
were unanimously adopted Conservative candidates.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>24.&mdash;During a severe gale from the N.N.W., accompanied by
heavy snow squalls, the Raby Castle, of 60 tons burden
(Greensides, master), went ashore at Salthouse, and became a
total wreck.&nbsp; She was bound from London to Stockton, with a
valuable cargo.&nbsp; The crew and passengers were saved.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When she broke up the beach was strewed with spirits,
wine, oranges, nuts, teas, toys, hampers, boxes, &amp;c.&nbsp;
The scene beggared description.&nbsp; The most outrageous and
beastly conduct was exhibited.&nbsp; Here might be observed a
group broaching a spirit cask, and letting it run into their
oil-skin hats, shoes, &amp;c.&nbsp; There another stood filling
their pockets and handkerchiefs.&nbsp; Plunder, wholesale
plunder, appeared to be the order of the day, in spite of
contingents of coastguard men.&nbsp; Many who were charged to
watch the property became themselves intoxicated.&nbsp; Many were
conveyed from the beach literally dead drunk, and it is with
disgust we add that many women were in the same
state.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cargo of the Raby Castle was worth
&pound;5,000; about &pound;800 worth was recovered.&nbsp; The
vessel was sold by auction for &pound;41.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;A fine specimen of the sea eagle was shot at
Blickling.&nbsp; It measured from tip to tip of the extended
wings 7 ft. 3&frac12; inches, and from the head to the tail 3
ft.&nbsp; Dowager Lady Suffield presented it to the Norfolk and
Norwich Museum.</p>
<p>13.&mdash;The tolls arising from the Norwich provision and
cattle markets, and from Tombland Fair, were, for the first time,
put up to public auction and let for the term of two years.&nbsp;

&pound;480; and of Tombland Fair, &amp;c., to Mr. Cooke for
&pound;250.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;Died at his residence, Chapel Field, Norwich, aged
48, Mr. Alfred Pettet, organist of St. Peter Mancroft and St.
Stephen&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mr. S. Critchfield was elected his
successor at St. Peter&rsquo;s, and Mr. Harcourt was appointed
organist at St. Stephen&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A performance of
&ldquo;The Messiah&rdquo; was given at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall on
May 26th for the benefit of the widow and family of the deceased,
by the choir of the Cathedral and the members of the Choral
Society, under the direction of Mr. Buck.</p>
<p>18.*&mdash;&ldquo;From an idea that when the new Registration
Act comes into operation the fees will be increased, numbers of
persons have thronged Yarmouth parish church for several Sundays
past, to have their children baptised, in order to avoid
additional expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;Matters were brought before the Lord Chancellor in
relation to affairs of the Norwich charities arising from the
Master&rsquo;s report assigning the several charities to certain
lists of trustees, and naming the parties to execute the
respective trusts.&nbsp; The only new point noticed was the
exception taken by a cross petition on the part of Mr. Bignold
and Mr. Rackham to the Master&rsquo;s report, first as to his
rejecting <i>en masse</i> every individual who was at its close,
or ever had been, a member of the old Corporation; and, secondly,
in not assigning to the Church list the Boys&rsquo; and
Girls&rsquo; Hospital trusts.&nbsp; The Chancellor decided
against the cross petition.&nbsp; (The leading charity of the
city, the Bishopgate Street Hospital, whose revenues formed
two-thirds of the whole of the trusts, was secured to a body of
trustees composed exclusively of members of the Church of
England.)&nbsp; In the House of Lords on April 24th Mr. Samuel
Bignold and Mr. William Rackham appealed from the order of the
Lord Chancellor referring it to the Master to approve of the
trustees of the charity estates of the Corporation.&nbsp; Their
lordships decided that they had jurisdiction to hear the appeal,
and time was given for the respondents to prepare their case.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Mr. Villebois&rsquo; staghounds had a remarkable
run.&nbsp; The stag was uncarted on Bradenham Green, and ran to
Shipdham.&nbsp; It was then headed back to Saham, after which it
went to Ovingon, and thence to Watton, Scoulton, Ellingham,
Caston, and Rocklands.&nbsp; Bearing away for Attleborough and
Besthorpe, it crossed the stream and went through Snetterton,
Eccles, and Larlingford, to Roudham, where it was taken after a
run of 35 miles.&nbsp; &ldquo;James Lynn, the huntsman, rode his
favourite horse, Cockfighter, which carried him at least eighty
miles that day.&nbsp; What makes the run more remarkable is that
the deer did <!-- page 359--><a name="page359"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 359</span>not run more than 200 yards upon any
roads during the whole distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>22.&mdash;A fire occurred at Rollesby Workhouse, which
completely destroyed one half of the building.&nbsp; &ldquo;The

their wives, being carried into effect, caused a great
disturbance,&rdquo; and it was supposed that the fire resulted
from motives of revenge.</p>

10.20 in the morning, and concluded at fifteen minutes past
midnight, when the jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the
prisoners were sentenced to death.&nbsp; The sentence on Varnham
was commuted on an ample confession by the other prisoners.&nbsp;
Large numbers of persons arrived at Norwich on April 22nd, to
witness the execution, which, however, had been ordered for the
29th.&nbsp; A full descriptive account of the supposed execution,
and of the behaviour of the men on the gallows, with a copy of
their confessions and their &ldquo;last dying words,&rdquo; was
hawked about the streets of the city.&nbsp; The capital sentence
was duly carried out on the 29th.&nbsp; The procession issued
from the castle doors at noon, headed by a number of javelin men
of the High Sheriff&rsquo;s posse.&nbsp; Smith, who was in the
last stage of a rapid decline, was assisted to the
scaffold.&nbsp; &ldquo;After the bolt was drawn and the bodies
swung round, a piercing cry of horror rose from the dense mass of
people of both sexes.&nbsp; After hanging the usual space of time
the bodies were taken down and carried into the interior of the
gaol, when all the prisoners were brought forward to view them in
the place where they lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7.&mdash;North Walsham Steeplechases took place over a four

and concerted pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>19.&mdash;Mr. G. V. Brooke (then under twenty years of age)
made his first appearance at Norwich Theatre as Romeo.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His performance was of that superior kind, exhibiting all
the fervour and enthusiasm of youth attempered by that
discriminating judgment and illumined by those nice and acute
perceptions which belong to the faculties of much maturer
years.&rdquo;&nbsp; He afterwards appeared as Ion, Othello,
Rolla, Richard the Third, William Tell, Hamlet, Rosenberg
(&ldquo;Ella Rosenberg&rdquo;), Macbeth, and Teddy (&ldquo;Teddy
the Tiler&rdquo;), and concluded his engagement on May
20th.&nbsp; Brooke was re-engaged for two nights&rsquo;

presented a most magnificent <i>coup d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i>.&nbsp;
A gallery had been erected from the foot of the railing before
the altar up to the centre of the east window, and occupied the

member of the Norwich Company, took his farewell benefit at the
Theatre.&nbsp; Mr. G. V. Brooke appeared in the character of
Virginius.&nbsp; Clifford died on June 8th, aged 68.&nbsp;
&ldquo;During the 36 years that he filled the office of prompter,

highly-cultivated intellect, Mr. Clifford was not less
distinguished for his goodness of heart, manliness of
disposition, and integrity of principle.&rdquo;</p>

returned to the Round House at Denton, midway between Harleston

regretted.&rdquo;</p>

Happing comprises 41 parishes, and it is remarkable that there is

<p>&mdash;*&ldquo;Last week a number of youngsters at Norwich had
an election for the members of the Lilliput Parliament.&nbsp; The
polling took place at the Old Library.&nbsp; After a severe
contest, during which it was alleged by the &lsquo;Purples&rsquo;
that a great deal of cooping, bribery, treating, and double
voting took place on the part of the &lsquo;Blues,&rsquo; and
that sums to the amount of two pence were given for a vote, the
&lsquo;Blues&rsquo; claimed the victory, and chaired their
members on the following day, with a splendid procession, banners
and flags flying, and the band playing, &lsquo;Wave your Blues
and Whites.&rsquo;&nbsp; The &lsquo;Purples&rsquo; did not
acknowledge this defeat, and on Tuesday last they also chaired
their candidate with a procession equal in grandeur, after which
the leading characters dined at the Bell Inn, and an election
ball took place in the evening, at which 320 persons were
present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>1.&mdash;Heavy rain and hailstorms occurred throughout the
county.&nbsp; &ldquo;At Stibbard and Guist during a severe

<p>9.&mdash;A shocking affair took place at Catton.&nbsp; Mr.
Jonathan Whitley Cooper, an attorney practising in Norwich, was
driving in a gig with his clerk (Thirkettle), when he was
accosted by a man named Cornelius Moor.&nbsp; Mr. Cooper drew a
pistol, discharged it at the man, and wounded him severely.&nbsp;
Moor was conveyed to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, where he
died the same night.&nbsp; On the following day Mr. Cooper was
apprehended and committed to the Castle on the charge of killing
Moor, and also of shooting at a man named Ford near the same
place, on the same evening, with intent to murder.&nbsp; The case
caused great excitement in Norwich.&nbsp; It was alleged that the
prisoner had entertained malice towards the deceased arising out
of circumstances connected with the Norwich election.&nbsp; Mr.
Cooper had been professionally engaged on the Conservative side,
and it was stated that the deceased, having promised to vote for
that party, voted for the Liberals.&nbsp; At the Coroner&rsquo;s
inquest the imputation of malice or any preconceived design was
so completely negatived by the evidence, and more especially by
the dying declaration of Moor, who was quite unknown to the
prisoner, that the jury returned a verdict of manslaughter, which
so greatly excited the indignation of the populace that they were
with difficulty prevented from assaulting the jurymen on their
leaving the Coroner&rsquo;s court.&nbsp; There was also a hearing
of the case before the Recorder (Mr. Preston) and another
magistrate, with the result that the prisoner was committed to
the Castle on the <i>mittimus</i> of the magistrates, and
confined in one of the felons&rsquo; cells.&nbsp; Application was
made to the county magistrates for bail, and was refused.&nbsp;
Under these circumstances, counsel was instructed to apply to the
Judge of the Queen&rsquo;s Bench for an order on the Norfolk
justices to admit the prisoner to <!-- page 366--><a

<p>1.&mdash;The weather on this day was of a beautiful and
spring-like character.&nbsp; During the remainder of the week
&ldquo;the moon in her first quarter and the planet Venus made
the evenings most brilliant.&nbsp; Never in the memory of man did

&pound;70,000, of which between &pound;50,000 and &pound;60,000
were in the Funds.&nbsp; His annual income at the time of his
death was upwards of &pound;2,100 a year, and his expenses were

sustains in the death of Mr. Samuel Woodward.&nbsp; He was an
excellent geologist, particularly as regards his native
county.&nbsp; His principal works were &lsquo;The Outline of the

non-commissioned officers, and privates of the Norfolk Yeomanry
Cavalry, Lord Sondes announced that the Government had disbanded
a great part of the Yeomanry force raised under precisely similar
conditions to their own.&nbsp; He added that he had resigned his
commission as Major-Commandant, and advised the regiment to
disband themselves and not wait to be dismissed.&nbsp; The Lord
Lieutenant afterwards appointed Capt. Loftus to the vacant
command; and the Dereham troop, partially disorganized by Lord
Sondes&rsquo; resignation, was re-formed in the Eastern division

Ives.&nbsp; The uniform of the regiment at this date &ldquo;was
like that of the 2nd Life Guards, with silver instead of gold
lace.&rdquo;</p>

Commons.&nbsp; &ldquo;A compromise was effected, by which one of
the members vacates, and Mr. Baring is to succeed.&nbsp; Counsel
for the petitioners unfolded a scene of profligate corruption to
an unparalleled extent.&nbsp; If the petition had been prosecuted
with the vindictive feeling and party spirit exhibited on a
former occasion, the committals to Newgate would have been so
numerous and <!-- page 373--><a name="page373"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 373</span>the prosecutions so sweeping as to
have carried ruin into many of the principal
families.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the election, which took place on
August 23rd, Mr. Baring was opposed by Mr. Wilshere, and the poll
was declared as follows:&mdash;Wilshere, 735; Baring, 702.&nbsp;

in less than an hour after the poll closed, and he actually did
it.&rdquo;</p>

afforded the opportunity of obtaining the elements of useful
knowledge and an acquaintance with the sacred
Scriptures.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Barwell seconded.&nbsp; Mr. Seppings

petitioners pray that you will not sanction any schemes of
education which do not include with the daily reading of the Holy
Scriptures a full measure of religious instruction based upon the

truth of the statement of the employers with reference to the
cause of the reduction of wages, namely, the great quantity of
camlets manufactured in and exported from Yorkshire.&nbsp; It was
resolved, after hearing the deputation, &ldquo;that the proposed
reduction was perfectly unnecessary, and that they were
determined to support a strike by all legal means in their
power.&rdquo;&nbsp; The business of Mr. Robberds was obstructed
by persons being prevented from taking work at reduced
prices.&nbsp; On August 27th a number of weavers complained to

the 14th she saw it again, but the heart had been taken out and
the corpse otherwise &ldquo;cut and hackled.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the
15th, accompanied by the mourners, she went to take the body away
for burial, but Mr. Perowne drove them out of the yard with a
gun, alleging that the corpse was his property, and that he had
paid for it sixteen years previously.&nbsp; It was afterwards
taken to the steeple of All Saints&rsquo; church, where it
remained without a shroud.&nbsp; Mr. Perowne was too drunk to
appear at court on that day, but he was apprehended, and on the
24th taken before the magistrates, to whom he stated that he had
purchased the body of the deceased during his lifetime, and
contended that it was his property.&nbsp; He had &ldquo;cut it
up&rdquo; in the interests of science.&nbsp; The magistrates
reminded Mr. Perowne that his practice did not require a
knowledge of the anatomy of the human body, and that his premises
were not licensed for anatomical studies.&nbsp; Mr. Perowne
replied that he was a member of St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s
Hospital.&nbsp; The Bench committed him for trial at the Assizes,

forward, with a sharp edge, supposed to be designed for cutting
the girths or reins of horses.&nbsp; It is said that about 60

with pistols, for the north of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a meeting
of the Town Council on March 11th the Mayor said, in reply to

exaggerated.&nbsp; Pikes had been manufactured, but there was not

smith, to make pikes for unlawful purposes, and was bound over to
appear at the Assizes.&nbsp; On the 14th the Chartists made a
demonstration on Mousehold Heath; the police force was
strengthened in consequence, special constables sworn in, and the
staff of the West Norfolk Militia held in readiness for immediate

church and interrupted the preacher, the Rev. P. Booth, with
hisses and noise.&nbsp; The church of SS. Simon and Jude was
visited on Sunday, the 25th, and hundreds were unable to gain

to many persons, several boats having earned as much as &pound;23
a year.&nbsp; The petition was referred to the magistrates, who
were asked to prohibit illegal fishing.</p>

Barker, of Thetford.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had rendered valuable

in the cause of Greek literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was buried at

that the Eastern Counties&rsquo; Railway is to terminate at
Colchester have been realised, as it seems the directors have
come to the conclusion not to carry it further, in accordance
with the wishes of the Lancashire proprietors, who hare so great
a stake in the undertaking.&rdquo;&nbsp; On May 6th a rule
<i>nisi</i> was granted in the Bail Court to compel the Company
to proceed with the works in accordance with their original
contract with the public.&nbsp; (The Act of Parliament was
obtained upon the representation that the line should be carried
from London to Yarmouth.)&nbsp; In the Court of Queen&rsquo;s
Bench on June 22nd Lord Chief Justice Denman, in delivering
judgment on the points raised, said: &ldquo;Upon the whole,
without coming to any final decision, we think the case is
involved in such doubt as to require the return of the mandamus,
and that a writ should go for that purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>9.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Mr. Justice Vaughan,
John Hall and Wm. Palmer were indicted upon the unusual charge of
stealing a bell from a parish church.&nbsp; The bell was lying in

assistance of a man named John Daniels (who turned Queen&rsquo;s
evidence), took it away in a cart, broke it up, and endeavoured
to dispose of the metal in Norwich.&nbsp; The prisoners were

charged with attempting to murder his wife by poisoning her with
arsenic, found guilty, and sentenced to death.&nbsp; The
execution took place on the Castle Hill, Norwich, on April
27th.&nbsp; &ldquo;He appeared to die an exceedingly hard
death.&nbsp; He clasped his hands, and raised his arms several
times towards his breast, as if in the act of prayer,
unquestionably showing that consciousness had not left him.&nbsp;
His remains were buried in St. Michael-at-Thorn
churchyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>13.*&mdash;&ldquo;We understand it is in contemplation to
revive in Norwich under different regulations and on a more
extensive scale those annual art exhibitions, which for the last
six years have ceased to take place.&nbsp; It is proposed to form
a society, through the medium of which artists and amateurs in
Norwich and its neighbourhood may have the opportunity of
offering to public inspection and patronage productions in any

occupied as a bazaar in St. Andrew&rsquo;s, is to form the
gallery.&rdquo;&nbsp; (The exhibition was opened on August

who died in 1783.&nbsp; Two years after her father&rsquo;s death
she developed a taste for versification, and in 1791 appeared the
first volume of her poems, dedicated to Mr. Wm. Drake, jun.,
M.P.&nbsp; The profits of the publication (from the contributions
of nearly 2,000 subscribers) enabled her for many years, with the
income arising from a small school, to support the declining age
of her mother.&nbsp; Another volume of her poems was published in
1821.</p>

threatening aspect of affairs in our Colonial possessions, and of
sedition manifest in England, and imploring her Majesty to summon
to her counsels &ldquo;all those upright and enlightened
statesmen whose consistent advocacy of Conservative principles
has obtained for them the respect and confidence of the
nation.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the 23rd the Norwich Town Council adopted
a counter address, &ldquo;thanking her Majesty for her choice of
ministers who deserve the regard of the nation by righteous
taxation, by extending commerce, by improving criminal and civil
laws, by commuting tithes, by amending the Poor-laws, by granting
self-government to the people by municipal corporations, and by

accomplished, and proceeded on the second hour, when he took 4s.
6d. more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.&mdash;The Norwich Tonnage Bill was read a third time in the
House of Commons.&nbsp; This measure was intended to provide a
new mode of application of the tolls and dues, first to defray
the expenses of obtaining the Act; secondly, to pay interest on
all sums borrowed under the powers of the Act, and to promote an
accumulative fund for the purpose of paying off all the principal
monies; and thirdly to keep in repair bridges, &amp;c., to free
Carrow Bridge, Duke&rsquo;s Palace Bridge, and Foundry Bridge, to

Margaret&rsquo;s parish for non-payment of Church rates, and
their goods were distrained and put up for auction in the
Saturday Market Place.&nbsp; Among other articles offered was a
silver-cased watch.&nbsp; Mr. Arrow not having a licence to sell

manner the watch was disposed of.&nbsp; On receiving the writ,
Mr. Arrow wrote to the Commissioners of Stamps and Taxes, giving
a full explanation of the circumstances, whereupon further
proceedings were stayed.</p>
<p>16.*&mdash;&ldquo;A new Paving Bill is being prepared by Mr.
C. S. Gilman, and its entire management is to be entrusted to a
committee of inhabitants and owners of property in Norwich and
the hamlets.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among its objects were the prevention
of the erection or maintenance of any toll-gate in any part of
the hamlets, the acquisition of powers to widen Briggs Street,
Theatre Street, and London Street; to open a carriage way through
the Back of the Inns from London Street to White Lion Street; to
afford public carriage communication from the Back of the Inns

Office was held at the Assembly Rooms, Norwich, &ldquo;to take
into consideration the examiners&rsquo; report, agreeable to the
resolutions of the meeting held on the 6th inst.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These proceedings arose mainly because of long-continued personal
attacks made upon Mr. Bignold by Mr. Bacon, editor of the
&ldquo;Norwich Mercury.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The character of Mr.
Bignold was placed on the highest pinnacle of unimpeachable
honour and good fame; and the present state of the
society&rsquo;s affairs is founded on that firm and equitable
basis of adjustment which fully warrants its members in looking
forward to years of increasing prosperity and success for the
establishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>21.&mdash;Wombwell&rsquo;s Menagerie was exhibited at
Norwich.&nbsp; The collection had largely increased in extent
since its previous visit, and included three elephants.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In consequence of the rapid growth of the enormous
elephant, G. W. has been obliged to erect the largest machine

<p>28.*&mdash;&ldquo;One night last week some persons stole from
the church at Swardeston one of the bells.&nbsp; The rogues broke
the bell to pieces on the spot, and although the blows must have
made a great noise, the villagers were not alarmed, and the

between Cricknell and Cain.&nbsp; After six rounds had been
fought, Cricknell was taken into custody by the &ldquo;Rural
Police,&rdquo; conveyed to Harleston, and bound over to keep the
peace for twelve months.&nbsp; &ldquo;The concourse of persons
was not so numerous as has been noticed on similar
occasions.&nbsp; Whether this arose from the necessary secrecy of
the scene of action, on account of the declared intentions of the
magistrates to put a stop to these demoralising sights, or the
early hour (ten o&rsquo;clock) the combatants set-to, cannot be
fully determined.&nbsp; But that these brutal attacks are fast
declining in the estimation of the middle classes may be fairly
presumed by the paucity in number and the circuitous route taken
by many of them to the battlefield.&rdquo;</p>

day, according to the official regulations.&nbsp; Our advertising
friends and correspondents will also be pleased to observe that
unless the penny postage be prepaid the expense of them will be

posted, or for twopence if paid when delivered.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
January 18th it was announced &ldquo;the penny postage reduction

thunderstorm raged with increased fury at Carlton Rode, where the
lightning struck the premises of Mr. James Ringer, a miller, and
set the thatch roof on fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;His married daughter
(Mrs. Matthews) was struck, and her clothes set on fire in twenty
different places.&nbsp; Her sister was also enveloped in
flames.&nbsp; The lightning inflamed her neck and shoulders, ran
down her back, her side and breast, ran down her legs, and burned
her heels, even the bottoms thereof, but neither her stockings
nor boots were the least injured.&nbsp; Of her upper apparel,
every article was burnt through and through.&rdquo;</p>

to a class of her Majesty&rsquo;s servants.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
February 4th Mr. J. Russell, of Drury Lane and Covent Garden,
appeared in the parts of Dominique (&ldquo;The Deserter&rdquo;)

constantly afflicted with sleepiness.&nbsp; &ldquo;He weighed at
the time of his death nearly 27 st., and had generally slept away
his time.&nbsp; He kept awake only a few minutes at a time, and
even in conversation fell asleep.&nbsp; Browne was several years
turnkey at the City Gaol, and was then by no means a man of over
size, but he had been increasing in bulk for several years,

entirely upon dry toast and tea.&nbsp; His coffin was 3 ft.

afterwards served in the Council Chamber, &ldquo;the principal
object on the table being a large wedding-cake, lavishly
decorated.&rdquo;&nbsp; At five o&rsquo;clock one hundred
gentlemen dined at the Swan Inn, under the presidency of the
Mayor.&nbsp; At night there was a firework display in the Market
Place.&nbsp; On the staging at the north-east angle of the Market

<!-- page 394--><a name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
394</span>delivered a lecture on &ldquo;The functions of the
brain phrenologically considered.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was really a
defence of the theory of phrenology, and gave rise to much
adverse comment.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;Died, aged 31, Mr. George Stannard, younger brother
of Mr. A Stannard, the Norwich artist.&nbsp; The deceased was
described as &ldquo;an artist of superior talents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>19.&mdash;Died, in his 108th year, Richard Pattle, of
Rudham.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was a poor but honest man, and had
through life earned his bread by the sweat of his brow, and was
so respected by his neighbours that they some time ago employed
an artist to take his likeness, from which a print was published,
and is now in possession of most of the neighbouring gentry and
farmers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>27.&mdash;A fire occurred on the newly-erected premises of Mr.

the Hundred of Henstead, held at the Bell Inn, Orford Hill,
Norwich, under the presidency of Mr. Robert Fellowes, it was
determined to present a petition to Parliament against any
alteration in the Corn Laws.&nbsp; The question was discussed at
a meeting of the Norwich Town Council on March 24th, on a motion
by Mr. Marshall that a petition be presented to Parliament
&ldquo;to repeal the present laws affecting the importation of
foreign corn, and to substitute such a duty as shall secure to
the agriculturists of the country present protection, with the
prospect of a progressive diminution of that duty as well as of
others which form our commercial code.&rdquo;&nbsp; The motion
was negatived.&nbsp; Mr. Bell, of the &ldquo;Farmers&rsquo;
Journal,&rdquo; delivered a lecture in Norwich Corn Hall at the
close of the market on March 28th, and argued that the theory of
Free Trade was false in the principle on which it professed to be
founded.&nbsp; On the 11th a public discussion took place at St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall between Mr. Bell and Mr. Ackland, one of the
lecturers of the Manchester Anti-Corn Law League.&nbsp; Many
meetings were held, for and against repeal, in different parts of

Emily, eldest daughter of John Crome, founder of the Norwich

tasteful and picturesque manner of grouping them.&rdquo;</p>

deemed necessary to perform the ridiculous operation nine
times.&rdquo;</p>

destruction.&nbsp; Handbills inviting tenders for the work have
for some time been in circulation.&nbsp; The principal object of
demolition is the splendid east window of the south isle, one of
the most elaborate examples of a highly-enriched style of
architecture in the county.&nbsp; This capacious building has
long been suffering from the effects of mutilations which every
admirer of our antient ecclesiastical architecture must
lament.&nbsp; The modern and ghastly eastern windows of the north
isle and chancel are deformities which would disgrace a
dilapidated church of the meanest village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>15.&mdash;Mr. Farren, of Covent Garden, and Mr. J. Vining, of
the same theatre, formerly a favourite actor in the Norwich
Company, commenced a short engagement at Norwich Theatre.&nbsp;
The plays in which they appeared included &ldquo;The Clandestine
Marriage,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Day after the Wedding,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The School for Scandal,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>&mdash;A public meeting, convened by the Mayor, was held at
the Guildhall, Norwich, &ldquo;for the purpose of congratulating
her Most Gracious Majesty and his Royal Highness Prince Albert on
their late most happy escape from the atrocious attempt at
assassination.&rdquo;&nbsp; The address was moved by Col. Harvey,
and seconded by Dr. Wright.&nbsp; The notorious Chartist, Dover,
moved a direct negative, which the Mayor refused to accept.&nbsp;
The address was then adopted.&nbsp; An address was also agreed to
by the Town Council on the 15th, and on the 21st the Mayor and
Corporation attended the thanksgiving service at the
Cathedral.&nbsp; Addresses were adopted by the Corporations of
Yarmouth and Lynn, by the clergy of the diocese, and by various
public bodies in the city and county, and a special form of
prayer was used at all the churches.&nbsp; A county meeting took
place at the Shirehall, Norwich, on June 27th, at which
congratulatory addresses to the Queen, the Prince Consort, and
the Duchess of Kent were adopted.&nbsp; Dover and a party of
Norwich Chartists occupied the gallery and created much
disturbance.</p>

399</span>16.&mdash;John Mountjoy, the pedestrian, commenced a
series of remarkable feats at Norwich.&nbsp; At Ranelagh Gardens
he performed the task of taking up with his mouth, without
touching the ground with his knees, 100 eggs placed a yard apart
and dropping them into a bucket of water without breaking them,
and leaping over 50 hurdles 4 ft. high placed ten yards apart,
making a distance of 6&frac12; miles.&nbsp; He undertook to do
this in one hour, and accomplished it in 58 minutes 56
seconds.&nbsp; On June 22nd he began his walk from the Shirehall
Tavern, Castle Ditches, to Symonds&rsquo; Gardens, Yarmouth, and
back twice a day for six successive days, a distance of 76
miles.&nbsp; He finished the undertaking on Saturday, June
27th.&nbsp; After he had crossed Foundry Bridge on his last
return journey he was followed by a tremendous crowd, who bore
the toll collectors before them and made a free passage.&nbsp;
The only remuneration Mountjoy received for his self-imposed task
were the contributions prompted by the generosity of the
public.&nbsp; On July 13th, at Ranelagh Gardens, he ran a mile,
walked backwards a mile, ran a wheelbarrow half a mile, trundled
a hoop a mile, hopped 200 yards, picked up with his mouth 40
hazel nuts placed a yard apart without putting his knees to the
ground, and jumped over 30 hurdles ten yards apart within five
minutes of the time stipulated, one hour.&nbsp; On August 31st he
started to walk to London and back, by way of Cambridge, in 48
hours.&nbsp; Leaving Ranelagh Gardens at four o&rsquo;clock in
the morning, he reached Wymondham at 5.5 and Thetford at 9.20,
Barton Mills before 11, and Newmarket at 12.45.&nbsp; After
leaving Newmarket, he incautiously drank some cold water, which
had such an effect upon him that he lay for an hour and a quarter
outside the Swan Inn at Bottisham.&nbsp; Having somewhat
recovered, he resumed his walk and reached Cambridge a little
before five o&rsquo;clock, and Melbourne at nine, where he was
again taken ill and obliged to lie down for an hour.&nbsp; He
then struggled on to Royston, where &ldquo;he was obliged to lie
down under a hedge, with none but strangers around
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; On reaching Buntingford he was advised to give
in, but he pursued his course to within a mile of Ware, when he
was obliged to relinquish the undertaking.&nbsp; Mountjoy, on
September 10th, jumped 144 hurdles and ran twelve times round the
racecourse on Mousehold Heath in 1 min. 4 sees, under the hour
(distance not stated); and on September 13th walked 20 miles
backwards and 20 forwards on the Catton Road, starting at 9 a.m.
and finishing at 7.4 p.m.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Died at Coltishall, aged 62, Mr. Thomas Stallard
Webb, historical engraver to the Queen.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the long
term of 38 years this eminent artist most assiduously devoted his
great talents, in conjunction with the late Thomas Holloway and
Richard Slann, who survives, exclusively to the engraving of the
celebrated cartoons of Raphael from the original paintings in the
possession of her Majesty, the last plate of which series was
completed only a few weeks before his death.&nbsp; This splendid
work will carry down his name to posterity amongst the first
artists of the age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>23.&mdash;The foundation-stone of Christ church, New Catton,
was laid by the Hon. and Very Rev. Dean Pellew, after a special
service at the mother church of St. Clement, at which the sermon

Apton.&nbsp; The architect was Mr. Brown, the contractors Messrs.
Wright and Cattermoul and Messrs. Watson and Neale, the site was
given by Mr. S. D. Page, and the entire cost of the work was
&pound;2,400.&nbsp; &ldquo;More than 300 years <!-- page 400--><a

an ancient church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>4.*&mdash;&ldquo;The very antient <i>lectorium</i> or
reading-desk which has for many years lain neglected in Norwich
Cathedral has, by order of the Hon. the Very Rev. the Dean,
recently been restored, and is now placed in the choir.&nbsp; It
was originally adorned with figures, which, in the time of the

been replaced by others cast in brass and elaborately chased by
Mr. John Herbert, from models furnished by Mr. Ollett.&rdquo;</p>

recently disposed of, is now refurnishing and fitting up with
every convenience for the reception of families and commercial

Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>23.&mdash;In recording the anniversary of an Oddfellows&rsquo;
Lodge at Lynn on this date, the <span class="smcap">Norfolk
Chronicle</span> stated: &ldquo;The name
&lsquo;Oddfellows,&rsquo; by which the Order is distinguished,
scarcely does justice to the institution, as corresponding with
its importance and its noble and generous principles.&nbsp; To
those who are unacquainted with the real merits of the society,
there is a sort of peculiarity in the title of
&lsquo;Oddfellows&rsquo; which may seem to imply something of
buffoonery united with thoughtless revelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>30.&mdash;Died, aged 50, Mr. B. Harrison, many years a popular
actor on the Norwich stage.</p>
<p>31.&mdash;Married, Mr. Charles Fisher, of the Norfolk and

&ldquo;Love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bennett was the son of an old actor
on the Norwich stage, and of Miss Tree it was said: &ldquo;She is
indeed one of Nature&rsquo;s <i>noblesse</i>, an histrionic
genius of the first order, an ornament to her arduous, anxious,
and ill-requited profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Mr. Justice Patteson,
John Randalsome, aged 40, was indicted for the murder of his
wife, at Thwaite, on June 19th.&nbsp; A singular feature of the
case was that none of the murdered woman&rsquo;s relatives were
aware that she was married to the prisoner.&nbsp; Randalsome had
formed an illicit acquaintance with a girl named Punchard, and
desired to be rid of his wife.&nbsp; Having enticed her from the
house of her father, with whom she resided, he wounded her
severely about the head and face with a hedge stake, and threw
her into a pond.&nbsp; The medical evidence proved that death
resulted from drowning.&nbsp; The jury returned a verdict of
guilty, and the prisoner was executed on the Castle Hill,
Norwich, on August 22nd.</p>
<p>&mdash;The new Amphitheatre and Royal Albert Saloon, Ranelagh
Gardens, St. Stephen&rsquo;s Gates, Norwich, was opened.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The building is after a new design, constructed with great
solidarity, and on a considerably increased scale of
dimensions.&nbsp; The circle is about 150 feet in circumference,
lighted up with a splendid chandelier of 20 gas burners,
suspended from the centre of the cone, which is glazed from the
top downwards about 15 ft.&nbsp; Round the spacious arena rise
lower and upper tiers of boxes splendidly fitted up.&nbsp; The
entrance to the circle and boxes is through a lofty and
well-proportioned saloon, about 70 ft. long and 30 ft.
wide.&nbsp; The fa&ccedil;ade of the building presents above the
principal entrance an open portico of three arches looking into
the gardens; and there is an exactly similar arcade opening
internally towards the theatre.&rdquo;&nbsp; A portion of the
building here described is now the Victoria Station of the Great
Eastern Railway.</p>
<h4>SEPTEMBER.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;At the King&rsquo;s Head Inn, Diss, the brewery,
public-houses, mansion, farm, and other property of Mr. Robert
Sheriffe, of Diss, were sold by auction by Mr. W. W. Simpson, of
London.&nbsp; The brewery and public-houses were purchased by Mr.
Samuel Farrow, and the amount realised by the three days&rsquo;
sale was &pound;50,000.&nbsp; &ldquo;The great increase in the
value of country public-houses apparent from the enormous prices
which have lately been realised for this description of property
leads us to believe that the shook which the trade suffered on
the passing of the Beer Bill some years since has been entirely
recovered, and that country public-houses are now even of greater
value than they were antecedent to the passing of that
measure.&rdquo;</p>

remains of Sir Thomas Browne, in the church of St. Peter
Mancroft, Norwich.&nbsp; &ldquo;The bones of the skeleton were
found to be in good preservation, particularly those of the
skull.&nbsp; The brain was considerable in quantity, but changed
to a state of adipocere resembling ointment of a dark brown
hue.&nbsp; The hair and the beard remained profuse and perfect,
though the flesh of the face as well as of every other part was
totally gone.&nbsp; With respect to the formation of the head, we
are informed that the forehead was remarkably low, but the back
of the cranium exhibited an unusual degree of depth and
capaciousness.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Browne died on October 12th,
1682.&rdquo;</p>

aged 90, Sylas Neville, M.D.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of this venerable
gentleman, for a great many years an inhabitant of this city,
living as he did in a state of perfect seclusion, there is little
to record beyond the fact of his having been born in London and
having taken his doctor&rsquo;s degree at Edinburgh, in
1775.&nbsp; His inaugural essay, &lsquo;De Prognosi in
Febribus,&rsquo; delivered on the occasion, is in print, and
bears testimony to his acquirements both as a classic and as a
pathologist.&nbsp; During many years and to the last moments of
his existence, Dr. Neville was chiefly indebted to the kindness
of friends around him for the means of subsistence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.&mdash;George Edward Seales, known as a common informer,
procured the conviction of a coach proprietor, at the Norwich

of Norwich, and Sir T. Fowell Buxton.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
ringleader, Dover, moved a resolution affirming that the meeting
&ldquo;views with deep regret the many proofs of despotic slavery
now increasing at home, and it therefore pledges itself to use

found to exist.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was negatived, amid great
uproar, and the resolutions drafted by the promoters of the
meeting adopted.</p>

during the interview, Capt. Ives rode backwards and forwards in
front of the office.&nbsp; Defendant was ordered to find
sureties, and keep the peace.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;The Bishop of Norwich confirmed 500 persons at
Diss.&nbsp; His <!-- page 407--><a name="page407"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 407</span>lordship, in the course of this
visitation, confirmed 10,464 young persons.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;Mr. Carter, &ldquo;the celebrated African Lion
King,&rdquo; appeared at Norwich Theatre &ldquo;with his troupe
of acting animals, consisting of lions, tigers, leopards, and
panthers, in a new drama, entitled, &lsquo;The Lion of the
Desert.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Carter took the part of
&ldquo;Abdallah, a dumb Arab.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It requires no
little nerve on the part of the actors and actresses to play to
such rough customers, and much credit is due to the members of
the Norwich Company who took a share in the
performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>17.&mdash;At Norwich, R. Coates, &ldquo;the great London
pedestrian,&rdquo; walked 50 miles in twelve hours; on the 18th
ran 50 miles, on the 19th ran 40 miles backwards, on the 20th ran
a pair of wheels 22 miles, rowed a boat 10 miles, jumped 300
flights of hurdles placed ten yards apart, and threw 100
somersaults.&nbsp; &ldquo;All these events on the several days
were performed in the space of twelve hours.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the
Green Hill Gardens, Norwich, Coates undertook to walk, on June
1st, 2nd, and 3rd, fifty miles in twelve hours each day,
&ldquo;half backwards and half forwards, and accomplished this
extraordinary feat the last day with ten minutes to
spare.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the same gardens, on June 30th, he
commenced walking 1,000 half miles in 1,000 successive
hours.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has to walk a half mile every succeeding
half hour day and night, but he has the privilege of walking two
half miles together, the last and first part of the
hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Coates was credited with the due
accomplishment of the feat.&nbsp; On August 10th a man named
Charles Thurlow began a walk of 1,000 miles in 1,000 hours at
Richmond Hill Gardens, Norwich, and completed what was said to
have been a genuine performance on September 21st.&nbsp; Another
pedestrian named Henry Raven, started to walk the same distance
in the same time on the Lord Nelson ground, Lakenham, on
September 29th, and completed his undertaking on November
10th.</p>
<p>&mdash;The Norfolk Yeomanry Cavalry, under the command of
Major Loftus, marched into Norwich, headed by their brass band,
and on the following day proceeded to Yarmouth for a week&rsquo;s
permanent duty.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Sir Jacob Astley, of Melton Constable, Norfolk, and
of Seaton Delaval, Northumberland, took his seat in the House of
Peers as Baron Hastings.&nbsp; The termination of the
long-pending abeyance of the Barony of Hastings in favour of Sir
Jacob was celebrated with great festivities at Foulsham and
Holt.&nbsp; &ldquo;According to the date of his barony, the 18th
of Edward I., 1290, next below Lord de Roos, Baron Hastings is
the most ancient baron of the United Kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Mr. G. V. Brooke commenced a six nights&rsquo;
engagement at Norwich Theatre.</p>
<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;At a meeting held at the Assembly Rooms, East
Dereham, under the presidency of Lord Sondes, it was agreed
&ldquo;that in consequence of the unprincipled attacks made upon
the owners and cultivators of the soil by the employment of hired
agitators to inflame the minds of the lower orders of society
against them, it is expedient that some steps be adopted for the
protection and defence of those interests.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
<!-- page 408--><a name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
408</span>also decided to form an association which was known as
the Central Norfolk Society for the Protection of Agriculture,
and was affiliated to the British Agricultural Protection
Association, an organization which worked in opposition to the
Anti-Corn Law League.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;A meeting was held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall,
Norwich, in pursuance of a requisition addressed to the Mayor,
stating that &ldquo;her Majesty&rsquo;s Ministers had been guilty
of an act of gross and wanton injustice and spoliation in
depriving the freemen of this and other cities and boroughs of
their vested municipal rights; that by their unremitting
endeavours to uphold and perpetuate in all their unmitigated
harshness and severity the heartless and oppressive provisions of
the new Poor Law they had evinced an utter disregard to the
wants, feelings, and rights of the poor, and that their recent
attempts to deprive the colonial and agricultural interests of
the empire of a just protection under the specious and delusive
pretext of supplying a deficiency in the revenue which their own
mismanagement had occasioned, had rendered them wholly unworthy
of the confidence of the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Between two
thousand and three thousand persons were present, and the
greatest confusion prevailed, owing to the action of a large body
of Chartists, led by the notorious John Dover.&nbsp; It was
proposed that Col. Harvey should take the chair, but the
Chartists elected one Matthew Smith, a working man.&nbsp; On the
latter assuming the presidency of the meeting, Col. Harvey, Mr.
Bignold, and other gentlemen left the hall.&nbsp; A number of
resolutions of a revolutionary character were adopted, and Dover,
at the conclusion of the meeting, congratulated his followers on
the success of the gathering, remarking that &ldquo;it had cost
the Tories &pound;20 for bills, and the Whigs &pound;20 for
bullies.&rdquo;&nbsp; The proceedings, which were of a very
orderly character, concluded with three cheers for Fergus
O&rsquo;Connor.&nbsp; Meanwhile the gentlemen who had convened
the original meeting adjourned to the Norfolk Hotel, where they
passed a series of resolutions emphasising the statements
contained in the requisition.&nbsp; During the whole of the
proceedings the hotel was besieged by a riotous mob, several
serious assaults were committed, and on the 3rd some of the
rioters were charged before the magistrates.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Litcham Races took place on this date.&nbsp; Among
the other local meetings was that at East Dereham, on June 23rd,
where the commencement of the sport was announced by the ringing
of the church bells, and the cup was won by Mr. Column&rsquo;s
c.g. Day Star.&nbsp; The trophy &ldquo;weighed 41 oz., and
contained by admeasurement eight pints of Howard&rsquo;s
sparkling champaign, which the fortunate winner twice filled, and
the company partook of it with true English feeling.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Yarmouth meeting took place on July 20th and 21st, the
Norfolk and Norwich Races were held on Mousehold Heath, Norwich,
on September 8th and 9th, and Swaffham Races on September
15th.</p>
<p>19.*&mdash;&ldquo;For nearly the middle of June, so cold a
season has never perhaps been experienced as during all last
week.&nbsp; Fires and great coats were in general requisition,
and coachmen and guards were to be seen muffled up as if we had
been in the depth of winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>28.&mdash;The Marquis of Douro and Mr. Benjamin Smith, the
retiring members, were nominated for the representation of
Norwich in Parliament.&nbsp; Dover, the Chartist, nominated a
third candidate, Mr. William Eagle, of Lakenheath, Suffolk.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Conservatives and Whigs, in <!-- page 409--><a
name="page409"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 409</span>the show of
hands, voted against Eagle, and the Sheriff declared the Marquis
of Douro and Mr. Smith duly elected.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dover thereupon
demanded a poll for Eagle, but was unable to deposit one-third of
the expense (about &pound;200).&nbsp; The proceedings were
temporarily adjourned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dover then went out of the
room, and, after the lapse of half an hour, <i>something</i> took
place which our readers will guess by the result.&nbsp; When
Dover came back there was no further demand for a poll&mdash;we
believe Dover received &pound;50 to withdraw the
nomination.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rumour quickly spread among the
Chartists that Dover had &ldquo;sold&rdquo; them.&nbsp; The mob
waylaid him in Dove Lane, and he retreated to the Guildhall for
protection.&nbsp; The windows of the room in which he was
supposed to have taken refuge were demolished by the stones
thrown by the mob, and the police who went out to quell the
disturbance were assailed by volleys of brickbats and other
missiles.&nbsp; The 7th Dragoon Guards were called out, the Mayor
read the Riot Act, and in the excitement and confusion Dover left
the Guildhall unnoticed.&nbsp; On the 29th the Chartists
assembled in force and went to the King&rsquo;s Head, St.
George&rsquo;s Colegate, where Dover lived with a woman named
Charlotte Humphrey.&nbsp; They burst into the house and found him
armed with his Chartist weapons, which were wrested from him; he
was knocked down, brutally belaboured, and hurried to the river,
and would have been thrown from the bridge had it not been for
the piteous intercession of one of his children.&nbsp; The mob
were moving towards the Market Place with their prisoner when he
was rescued by the police.&nbsp; At the same time a detachment of
dragoons, commanded by Cornet Crofts, with the Mayor at their
head, rode up, a coach was procured, and Dover, having been
placed inside, was conveyed, under military escort, to the City
Gaol, where his serious injuries were attended to by the surgeon
of the prison.&nbsp; On the 30th several persons appeared before
the magistrates and were punished for taking part in the
disturbances.&nbsp; Public tranquillity was somewhat restored the
same day by a procession in which &ldquo;Philip Augustus, the
musical pieman,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jerry, the lucifer match
seller, in a military costume, with an immense plume of feathers
in his cap,&rdquo; were &ldquo;chaired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>28.&mdash;Lord George Bentinck and Sir Stratford Canning were
returned unopposed for the borough of King&rsquo;s Lynn.</p>
<p>&mdash;Mr. W. Wilshere, Mr. C. E. Rumbold, Mr. Thomas Baring,
and Mr. Joseph Soames were nominated candidates for the
representation of Yarmouth.&nbsp; The proceedings were marked by
great disorder.&nbsp; The polling, on the 29th, resulted as
follows:&mdash;Wilshere, 945; Rumbold, 943; Baring, 501; Soames,
494.&nbsp; The two first named were declared elected.</p>
<p>30.&mdash;Thetford election took place.&nbsp; The Hon. W.
Bingham Baring (Conservative), 86; Lord Euston (Whig), 71; Sir
James Flower (Conservative), 71.&nbsp; Before a Committee of the
House of Commons, on May 4th, 1842, a petition was presented on
behalf of Sir James Flower, on the ground that several votes
polled for Lord Euston were bad, as the voters had lost their
qualifications.&nbsp; His lordship declined to take any part in
these proceedings.&nbsp; The objection against one voter having
been sustained, Sir James Flower was placed in a majority, and
the Committee then passed the following
resolution:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Right Hen. Henry FitzRoy,
commonly called the Earl of Euston, was not duly elected member
for the borough of Thetford; that Sir James Flower, <!-- page
410--><a name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
410</span>Bart., was duly elected, and ought to have been
returned; and that the Committee have altered the poll by
striking off the vote of William Burlingham from the poll of the
Earl of Euston.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>JULY.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;Mr. William Bagge and Mr. W. Lyde Wiggett Chute, the
former members, were nominated and returned unopposed as members
for West Norfolk.&nbsp; &ldquo;The town of Swaffham was one blaze
of pink and purple.&rdquo;&nbsp; The candidates were escorted to
the Shirehall by an imposing procession, and after the nomination
the election dinner was held at the Assembly Rooms, under the
presidency of the Hon. Francis Baring.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;Mr. Edmond Wodehouse and Mr. Henry Negus Burroughes,
the former Conservative members for East Norfolk, entered Norwich
at the head of a great cavalcade of freeholders, and were
nominated at the Shirehall.&nbsp; Mr. Palmer, Recorder of
Yarmouth, and Mr. William Wilde, Coroner for Norwich, nominated
and seconded Sir William J. H. B. ffolkes as the Whig
candidate.&nbsp; The polling, on the 13th, was declared as
follows:&mdash;Wodehouse, 3,498; Burroughes, 3,437; ffolkes,
1,379.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;Died at Denton, near Harleston, Sarah Witton, aged
100 years, &ldquo;leaving twenty-nine great-grandchildren still
living, they being the origin of one daughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
deceased was &ldquo;the daughter of John and Eleanor Middleton,
who lived to attain to the great age of 105 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>15.&mdash;Died in the Chantry, Norwich, Monsieur De Rouillon,
&ldquo;an eminent professor and teacher of French, and
extensively known as the author of several grammatical and other
useful literary works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&mdash;At the Norwich Assizes, before Mr. Justice Williams,
a special jury tried the important action, Palmer and another
<i>v.</i> Irving, chairman of the Alliance Insurance
Company.&nbsp; The action was brought by the executors of a
person of the name of Howes to recover from the company the sum
of &pound;1,503, the amount of a policy on the life of
Howes.&nbsp; The defendant disputed the liability to pay, on the
ground that Howes had suffered from consumption, was addicted to
habits prejudicial to life, and that the policy had been obtained
by fraud.&nbsp; After a long trial, an arrangement was arrived
at, and a verdict given for the defendant, both sides to pay
their own costs, and the policy to become void.&nbsp; Policies
with other offices were similarly affected by the result of the
trial.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Mr. Justice Williams,
John Self, aged 20, was charged with the murder of Jemima
Stimpson, aged 15, at Wymondham, on July 17th.&nbsp; The prisoner
killed the girl by striking her on the head with a spade, and
afterwards threw the body into a pond.&nbsp; He was found guilty,
sentenced to death, and on August 14th executed on the Castle
Hill, Norwich.</p>
<h4>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>16.&mdash;The two troops of the 7th Dragoon Guards marched
from the Cavalry Barracks, Norwich, <i>en route</i> for
Ireland.&nbsp; On the 25th a portion of the 13th Light Dragoons,
recently returned from active service <!-- page 411--><a
name="page411"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 411</span>in India,
marched in.&nbsp; The headquarters of the regiment were stationed
at Ipswich.&nbsp; The commanding officer was Lieut.-Col. Richard
Brunton, youngest son of Mr. John Brunton, formerly manager of
Norwich Theatre, and brother of the Dowager Countess Craven.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;Experiments were made on Yarmouth beach, in the
presence of coastguard officers, with the view of testing the
capabilities of Manby&rsquo;s mortar and Dennett&rsquo;s rocket
in carrying out a line for effecting communication with stranded
vessels.&nbsp; &ldquo;The result of the experiments appears to be
that each apparatus is possessed of qualities peculiar to
itself.&nbsp; The rocket unquestionably carries the furthest, and
flies with great precision.&nbsp; It is also more portable, but
the unanimous opinion was that the rocket and mortar should go
together, and so far from being considered rivals, they should be
regarded as coadjutors in promoting the beneficent object which
each must have in view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&mdash;A four-oared match between London and Norwich crews,
for &pound;50 a side, took place from Coldham Hall to Thorpe
Gardens, distance seven miles.&nbsp; The crews were composed as
follow: London&mdash;Lett (stroke), Moulton, Maynard, Perry, G.
Maynard (cox.).&nbsp; Norwich&mdash;William Gurling (stroke),
Henry Gurling, Clarke, Tom Lefevre, W. Buttle (cox.).&nbsp; The
boats started at 4.30 p.m.; the Londoners rowed the distance in
53 minutes, and the Norwich men in 56 minutes.&nbsp; The London
boat, the most perfect specimen of a four-oar ever seen in
Norwich, weighed 124 lbs.&nbsp; In a second match, on August
28th, in Norwich-built boats, from Bramerton to Thorpe, the
London crew won by 25 seconds.&nbsp; On the same day a match
between London and Norwich amateurs (London: Messrs. Chinery and
Thompson; Norwich: Messrs. Clabburn and Russell), was rowed from
Postwick to Thorpe (two miles), stakes &pound;10.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The striking of the flags was nearly simultaneous, but the
Londoners were declared the winners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;A balloon ascent was made from Lynn Gasworks by Mr.
Gypson, accompanied by Mr. Thomas Oxley and Mr. D. Nelson.&nbsp;
A second ascent took place on September 9th.&nbsp; On September
18th Mr. Gypson ascended from Swaffham Gasworks.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Wood commenced an operatic engagement at
Norwich Theatre.&nbsp; The productions included &ldquo;La
Somnambula,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fra Diavolo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Love in a
Village,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Waterman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>14.&mdash;The Coltishall Brewery estate, consisting of a
residence and cottages, 53 inns and public-houses, and about 260
acres of land, formerly the property of Mr. Robert Howes,

Norwich, by Mr. W. W. Simpson, of London, and realised about
&pound;50,000.</p>
<h4>OCTOBER.</h4>
<p>13.&mdash;Van Amburgh, with his collection of trained animals,
performed at Lynn.&nbsp; &ldquo;The elephant arrived covered with
a sort of coat <i>&agrave; la </i><!-- page 412--><a
name="page412"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
412</span><i>Mackintosh</i>, and, to prevent injury to his feet,
he had something on in the shape of boots.&rdquo;&nbsp; The show
also visited Norwich, and was located in the Ranelagh
Gardens.&nbsp; &ldquo;As a menagerie it is inferior to
Wombwell&rsquo;s; as a spectacle it is scarcely to be compared
with Carter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>19.&mdash;At the Norwich Quarter Sessions, before Mr. Isaac
Jermy, Recorder, Jacob Macro, woollen draper, refused to take the
oath as a member of the grand jury, &ldquo;because Scripture said
&lsquo;Swear not at all.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Recorder: Then, sir, I
think it right to fine you the sum of &pound;50, to be paid to
the use of her Majesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fine was subsequently
reduced to &pound;20.</p>
<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>8.&mdash;An exceedingly rare fish, the maigre (<i>sci&aelig;na
aquila</i>), was captured off Sheringham.&nbsp; It measured 5 ft.
2 in. in length, weighed 68&frac12; lbs., and was preserved by
Mr. George Johnson, chemist, of Norwich.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;At a meeting of the Norwich Paving Commissioners, it
was decided to try the experiment of paving Briggs&rsquo; Street
with wood.&nbsp; It was suggested that &ldquo;pieces of fir 14
in. or 15 in. long, having been peeled, be put down as they grow,
with gravel between each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;Mr. John Marshall was elected Mayor of Norwich, and Mr.
William Storey appointed Sheriff.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;On the arrival at Norwich of the intelligence of the
birth of the Prince of Wales, the Union flag was hoisted on the
towers of St. Peter Mancroft, St. Stephen, St. Giles, and of
other parish churches, and the bells of St. Peter rang rejoicing
peals.&nbsp; On Sunday, the 14th, a special form of thanksgiving
was used at the church services; on November 16th and December
4th the Norwich Town Council and the county magistrates voted
addresses of congratulation to the Queen and Prince Albert; and
on December 7th the Bishop of Norwich gave a dinner to the
inmates of the Workhouse.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Queen graciously
received the congratulations of the boys of Paston Grammar
School, North Walsham, and requested that an additional week of
holidays be granted to them at the ensuing Christmas vacation, in
commemoration of the happy event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>13.&mdash;On this date was published the judgment given in the
Consistory Court of Norwich, by Mr. Evans, in the suit, Loftus
husband <i>v.</i> Loftus wife.&nbsp; The suit was brought by the
Rev. Arthur Loftus, of Fincham, against Mary Anna Ray Loftus, for
restitution of the conjugal rights of marriage.&nbsp; The Court
ruled that Mr. Loftus was fully entitled to judgment, and
admonished Mrs. Loftus to return to her husband.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;Died at Blickling Hall, the seat of the Dowager Lady
Suffield, John William Robert Kerr, Marquis and Earl of Lothian,
aged 48.&nbsp; The funeral of the deceased nobleman took place at
Blickling church, on November 24th.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;Christ church, New Catton, was consecrated by the
Bishop of Norwich, and the sermon was preached by the Hon. and
Rev. J. T. Pelham, rector of Berghapton.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Chartists marched in procession to the church and were refused
admission, and then commenced every possible description of
insult and injury.&nbsp; The Bishop and other <!-- page 413--><a
name="page413"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 413</span>gentlemen,
on leaving the church, were scandalously assailed by the mob;
near St. Clement&rsquo;s church some stones were thrown, and it
was with difficulty that the crowd was kept off.&nbsp; The Right
Rev. prelate was escorted to the Palace, and at the gate three
cheers were given for his lordship.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eleven arrests
were made, and several convictions were recorded during the two
days&rsquo; hearing at the Police Court.&nbsp; The ringleader, a
man named Hewett, was committed for trial at the Quarter
Sessions, and on January 4th, 1842, the Recorder (Mr. Isaac
Jermy) sentenced him to two calendar months&rsquo; imprisonment,
ordered him to find two sureties and keep the peace for twelve
months, and to remain in custody until such sureties were
forthcoming.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;At the dinner of the Marham Hunt, held at the Crown
Inn, Swaffham, Mr. Henry Villebois was presented with a silver
candelabrum, weighing 200 oz., in recognition of &ldquo;the
liberal and sporting manner in which he had contributed to the
general amusement&rdquo; of the members of the Hunt.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;A meeting of landowners and others was held at
Yarmouth, for the purpose of considering a scheme proposed by Mr.
Robert Stephenson, for constructing a railway from Yarmouth to
Norwich.&nbsp; Two other proposed railways were before the
public, and in both cases it was proposed to construct bridges
over the river.&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s railway, first known
as the Valley Line, pursued a route which obviated the necessity
of crossing the river, but the scheme included a plan for
diverting the course of the stream at Thorpe for a distance of
about 50 chains.&nbsp; The scheme, which was estimated to cost
&pound;150,000, was adopted, and the line, the first to be opened
in Norfolk, was called afterwards the Yarmouth and Norwich
Railway.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;The celebrated Distin family gave the first of three
concerts at the Theatre Royal, Norwich.</p>
<p>27.*&mdash;&ldquo;The memorial statue of the late venerable
Bishop Bathurst, by the far-famed hand of Chantrey, has been
erected this week in Norwich Cathedral.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the
last work of Chantrey, who died in London shortly after his
departure from Norwich.&nbsp; &ldquo;The estimate for the
monument of Bishop Bathurst was &pound;2,500; Chantrey took it
for &pound;1,500; the block of Carrara marble alone must have
cost him nearly &pound;1,000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;The Census returns were published on this date.&nbsp;
The statistics affecting Norwich were as follow:&mdash;Houses,
inhabited, 13,889; uninhabited, 805; building, 53;
persons&mdash;males, 28,014; females, 33,832; total,
61,846.&nbsp; The population of Norfolk, exclusive of Norwich,
was 350,775.</p>
<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>7.&mdash;A flood occurred at Norwich, after twenty-four
hours&rsquo; rain.&nbsp; It was the sixth that had taken place
since October 5th.&nbsp; &ldquo;The waters were as high if not
higher than on any former inundation of our marshes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>23.&mdash;The Phenomena coach, with its Christmas load,
started from Norwich, drawn by a team of six greys, &ldquo;which
were all managed by Mr. Thomas Wiggins, in a style which would
have done credit to a <!-- page 414--><a name="page414"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 414</span>first-rate whip, and which was never
before attempted by any coachman on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>24.*&mdash;&ldquo;We have lately had exhibited in Norwich a
new system of skaiting on the saloon in the Ranelagh Gardens and
at the Corn Exchange.&nbsp; It is called Tachypos, and is a kind
of skait each running on two iron wheels about six inches in
diameter, and fastens on to the foot in a similar way to the
common skait, with protection to the legs up to the knees.&nbsp;
With these persons may travel at the rate of nine miles an hour
upon the common road.&nbsp; The Tachypos is invented by Mr. J.
Ayton, of this city, and differs considerably from the Tachypos
lately exhibited at the principal theatres in London.&nbsp; There
are at this moment boys exhibiting upon them, and are cutting
round the corners and corn-stands with all imaginable ease and
rapidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;Wombwell&rsquo;s Menagerie arrived at Norwich, and was
exhibited on the Castle Hill.&nbsp; The collection included a
pair of giraffes, one of which was killed by an accidental
fall.&nbsp; &ldquo;The elephant is a magnificent animal, but we
think the walking exercise which Van Amburgh&rsquo;s elephant is
obliged to take, instead of being drawn from place to place by
some twelve horses, conduces to a clearer complexion and a better
state of health.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the first time, Wombwell
advertised that he had a keeper &ldquo;who goes into the den of
the trained lions and tigers.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>1842.</h3>
<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>7.&mdash;At a meeting of the county magistrates, held at
Norwich, the Earl of Orford presented a petition signed by a very
large number of occupiers of land, &ldquo;praying for a
considerable change, if not a total abrogation, of the police
force, as the introduction of the force had not decreased either
the number of robberies or cases of vagrancy, while the expenses
of the county were much increased by the costs arising from the
prosecution of persons apprehended by the police for offences of
a very trivial nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rev. J. C. Collyer
presented a counter petition from the clergy, landowners, and
inhabitants of Reepham, &ldquo;praying that no alteration take
place in the county police, which had been found a most useful
body in that part of the county.&rdquo;&nbsp; A resolution was
unanimously adopted affirming that great benefits had been
derived from the introduction of the police, and thanking Col.
Oakes, the Chief Constable, for his exertions in the formation of
the force.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;Deputations from the various agricultural societies
in East Norfolk attended a meeting at the Norfolk Hotel, Norwich,
at which the East Norfolk Agricultural Association was formed,
for the exhibition of stock and agricultural implements in
Norwich or its vicinity.&nbsp; Lord Wodehouse was elected
president, and Mr. E. C. Bailey secretary.&nbsp; The first show
was held on Norwich Cricket Ground, on September 13th.&nbsp;
There were twenty-four classes of live stock, and four entries of
implements; 800 persons were present, and the sum of &pound;40
was taken at the gates.&nbsp; Lord Wodehouse presided at the
dinner, held at the Assembly Rooms.</p>
<p><!-- page 415--><a name="page415"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
415</span>14.&mdash;The Lynn mail coach, on its journey to
London, overturned between Melbourne and Royston, and Simpson,
the coachman, was killed.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;&ldquo;Died last week, in the 85th year of his age,
Mr. Thos. Leech, hosier, one of the oldest inhabitants of
Diss.&nbsp; He was the representative of the venerable Bishop
Blaize in the last procession of the wool-combers held at Diss at
about the same time the like pageant was exhibited at Norwich,
Diss having been esteemed a great manufactory of hosiery, and one
of the chief in Norfolk and Suffolk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>19.&mdash;At a meeting held at the Guildhall, Norwich, it was
decided to celebrate the christening of the Prince of Wales by
the erection of an almshouse, and to raise &pound;1,000 for
carrying out the scheme.&nbsp; At an adjourned meeting, on
January 25th, the resolution was rescinded, because &ldquo;the
opening of an alms-house was only the opening of a pauper
warren.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the same day a dinner was given at the
Royal Hotel, a ball took place at the Assembly Rooms, and the
inmates of the Workhouse were entertained.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;Richard Cricknell, the Norwich pugilist, died on this
date.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had never been well since he fought with

<p>4.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Mr. Serjeant
Atcherley, George Barber, aged ten years, was indicted, upon the
Coroner&rsquo;s inquisition, for murdering John Smith, aged
eight, by throwing him over Shotford Bridge into the river
Waveney, on November 6th, 1841.&nbsp; The only direct evidence to
criminate the prisoner was his own confession, which was
extracted from him by a witness who had chained him up and
frightened him by threats.&nbsp; The Commissioner directed the
jury to acquit the prisoner, who was afterwards received into the
establishment of the Philanthropic Society, St. George&rsquo;s
Fields, London.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;A singular case was tried at the Norfolk Assizes,
before Lord Chief Justice Tindal.&nbsp; The defendants, John
Utting and Anna Bunn, were indicted for conspiring against one
Daniel Durrant, of Winterton, a criminal then under sentence of
transportation for life.&nbsp; Durrant, at the Summer Assizes in
1841, was charged with committing a rape upon Bunn, on whose
evidence and that of John Utting, a constable at Filby, he was
convicted and sentenced.&nbsp; Soon afterwards Durrant&rsquo;s
wife died of grief, and Bunn, labouring under the pangs of
remorse, <!-- page 417--><a name="page417"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 417</span>confessed to the Rev. Mr. Sidney, of
Acle, that the statements which procured the conviction of
Durrant were false.&nbsp; It was further shown that Utting had
planned with Bunn to ruin Durrant.&nbsp; The jury now found that
Durrant was not guilty of the charge on which he was convicted,
and returned a verdict of guilty against Utting, while Bunn, who
had not been called upon to plead, was discharged.&nbsp; Utting
was taken before the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench, on May 9th,
and was there sentenced by Mr. Justice Patteson to twelve
calendar months&rsquo; imprisonment in Norwich Castle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The issue of the prosecution was that Durrant was restored
to liberty and returned home.&nbsp; Only three years ago he would
have been executed for this crime.&nbsp; He was formerly an
innkeeper, with a good business.&nbsp; Through this unfounded
charge he has lost his wife, who died of a broken heart, and he
and his three young children are now destitute.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Public subscriptions were made on behalf of this unfortunate
man.</p>

gudgeon of the tenor broke, which, with the stock and implements,

ringers were more frightened than hurt.&rdquo;</p>

a county gaol since the year 1345, and was finally vested in the
magistrates of Norfolk for that purpose by Royal grant confirmed
by Parliament in 1806.&nbsp; The ornamental work and facing of
the exterior having fallen into a state of extreme decay, the
same was ordered to be restored at the expense of the county by
the Court of Quarter Sessions, in April, 1834.&nbsp; Its
restoration was carried <!-- page 421--><a

work in Bath stone, as most resembling that of Normandy, which
had been originally used, under the superintendence of the
visiting justices, and completed in 1839.&nbsp; The battlements
and corbel table were designed from the best discoverable
authorities, as no portion remained of the original termination

Cambridge.&nbsp; The Leander had the lead of King&rsquo;s
College, and Cambridge the lead of Norwich.&rdquo;&nbsp;

<p>24.&mdash;A singular story of a supposed murder was
published.&nbsp; A human skeleton was recovered from the bed of
the river at Costessey Mills by a &ldquo;didling&rdquo; boat
owned by Messrs. Culley.&nbsp; The circumstance was recalled that
a Jew pedlar, known as &ldquo;Old Abraham,&rdquo; had
mysteriously disappeared eight years previously.&nbsp; It was
also remembered that one Robert Page, sentenced to transportation
for life for sheep stealing at Drayton, on March 27th, 1834, had
told the prison warders that if he were taken to Costessey he
could show them, beneath <!-- page 424--><a

tree, &ldquo;something that would make their hair stand on
end.&rdquo;&nbsp; By a curious coincidence, the skeleton was
found beneath a willow which overhung the river.&nbsp; It was
stated that the body had been staked down in the bed of the
stream.</p>

daughter, Miss Vining, appeared on the 16th in the parts of
Benedict and Beatrice, and fulfilled an engagement of seven
weeks.&nbsp; The season, one of the most successful that Mr.

number of &ldquo;bespeaks&rdquo; given, amongst others, by the
officers of the 13th Light Dragoons, the Royal and Norfolk Hotel
Wine Clubs, the Governor and Deputy-Governor of the Court of
Guardians, &amp;c.</p>

lightning and thunder.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;The first annual meeting of the Norfolk Flax Society,
the object of which was &ldquo;to promote the cultivation of a
plant for the produce of which vast sums of money are annually
sent abroad,&rdquo; was held at Norwich.&nbsp; It was stated that
the soil and climate of the county were &ldquo;equal and perhaps
superior to any in the world for the growth and perfection of the
plant, and its cultivation would be more profitable than that of
any other crop.&rdquo;&nbsp; The method of &ldquo;forming linseed
into compound to fatten cattle&rdquo; was demonstrated in a booth
on the Castle Meadow, and an exhibition of articles manufactured
from flax was held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; The Hon. W.
R Rous was President of the Society, to which about eighty
prominent agriculturists belonged.&nbsp; M. Demann, a Belgian
agriculturist, was engaged as the Society&rsquo;s agent, and many

movement.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;The promoters of the scheme for the erection of the
Leicester monument appointed a &ldquo;committee of taste,&rdquo;
who recommended the building of a column, of artistic
design.&nbsp; At a meeting held at the Norfolk Hotel, on January
21st, the much vexed question of the site was discussed and a
decision was given in favour of Holkham Park, mainly by the votes
of a number of subscribers of ten shillings each in the
neighbourhood of Wells.&nbsp; Efforts were made to secure the
erection <!-- page 425--><a name="page425"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 425</span>of the monument at Norwich, and the
supporters of either place were invited to vote upon the
subject.&nbsp; After the poll a scrutiny was held, and on August
5th it was announced that 322 votes had been given in favour of
Holkham, and 281 in favour of Norwich.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Died, aged 60, at Birmingham, Mr. Vaughan, &ldquo;the
highly respectable musician and once excellent tenor
singer.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a native of Norwich, and when quite
young was a member of the choir of St. George&rsquo;s Chapel,
Windsor.&nbsp; He was afterwards engaged at Westminster Abbey,
St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and the Chapel Royal.&nbsp; On the
death of Mr. Harrison, in 1812, Mr. Vaughan was appointed
principal tenor at the King&rsquo;s Concerts of Ancient Music, he
sang at most of the provincial musical festivals, and was a

<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>14.&mdash;The first touring circus in Norfolk at which
performances were given under canvas was that belonging to Batty,
&ldquo;sole proprietor of Astley&rsquo;s Royal
Amphitheatre,&rdquo; who on this date erected at Lynn Mart a tent
65 ft. in height and 300 ft. in circumference.&nbsp; It was the
same tent placed on the site of the Royal Exchange when Prince
Albert laid the first stone of the new building, and on that
occasion it afforded accommodation for 1,400 persons.&nbsp; In
the autumn of the same year Richard Sands&rsquo; American circus
toured the county, giving one performance only in a
&ldquo;spacious pavilion&rdquo; at each town visited.&nbsp; A
procession of &ldquo;twenty-five caparisoned horses&rdquo; was a
feature of the show.&nbsp; After this date the circus touring
system became general during the summer and autumn months.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;Died at Caen, Normandy, aged 76, the Rev. T.
D&rsquo;Eterville, &ldquo;a well-known and respected inhabitant
of Norwich for upwards of forty years, who retired a few months
ago to end his days in his native country.&rdquo;&nbsp;

tongues.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>23.&mdash;The coach from London to Norwich, driven by Thomas
Wiggins, ran into a brewer&rsquo;s dray at Tasburgh, during a
thick fog and was overturned.&nbsp; Mr. Scott, of Newton
Maid&rsquo;s Head, one of the outside passengers, was jammed
between the coach and a tree, which had to be cut down to
extricate him, Wiggins was thrown head first off the box seat and
severely injured, and the guard, Thomas, was dashed against a
tree stump and killed outright, &ldquo;his head being completely
split open.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not until January 22nd, 1844,
that Wiggins was able to resume his duties.&nbsp; It was then
stated: &ldquo;So highly is this excellent whip esteemed along
the line of road, that at the several inns where the coach
stopped to change horses it appeared as if the landlords had
determined to celebrate the circumstance by making it a general
gala day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&mdash;Died at Cheltenham, aged 60, Major-General Sir John
Thomas Jones, Bart., K.C.B., of Cranmer Hall.&nbsp; He served in
the Royal Engineers during the campaign in Calabria, and was

in the Peninsular campaign he was in the retreat to Corunna; he
accompanied the expedition to Walcheren and was present at the
reduction of Flushing, served in the campaigns of 1810, 1811, and

the siege of Burgos, in October, 1812.&nbsp; He entered the
service as second-lieutenant on August 30th, 1798, and retired
with the rank of major-general on January 10th, 1837.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;Yarmouth Orange Fair was held.&nbsp; &ldquo;Like the
generality of fairs, it has fallen sadly out of repute, and but
for the immense quantity of fruit from which it takes its name
anyone might have passed the Market Place without noticing
it.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>MARCH.</h4>
<p>17.&mdash;At a special meeting of the Norwich Town Council, on
the motion of Mr. A. Dalrymple, a petition to Parliament was
adopted in opposition to the Income Tax, on the ground that it
was &ldquo;unjust, unwise, repugnant, and
unproductive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>18.&mdash;The Watton coach, on its way from Norwich, with six
female outside passengers, stopped at Barford Cock.&nbsp; During
the temporary absence of Allen, the coachman, the horses started

Hingham.&nbsp; With the exception of a wheel being taken off a
passing vehicle, no damage was done.</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>4.&mdash;At the Norwich Assizes, before Lord Chief Justice
Tindal, was tried the case, the Queen against Edward
Painter.&nbsp; The prosecution, for assault, was instituted by
Mr. Jeremiah Cross, corn merchant, of Norwich.&nbsp; An
indictment had been preferred at the Norwich Quarter Sessions and
a true bill returned, which the defendant removed by writ of
<i>certiorari</i>, and the case now came on for trial on the
civil side of the Court.&nbsp; The plaintiff, in June, 1842, was
invited to the Rising Sun Inn, kept by Mr. John Abel, and he was
there met by Painter, who for several minutes thrashed him with
an ash stick so severely that for a considerable time afterwards
plaintiff was under medical treatment.&nbsp; For the defence it
was alleged that Cross had grossly insulted the defendant&rsquo;s
daughter, hence the thrashing.&nbsp; The jury found a verdict of
guilty, and on May 10th, when defendant appeared before the Court
of Queen&rsquo;s Bench to receive judgment, he was fined one
shilling and discharged.&nbsp; On June 24th the following
advertisement was published: &ldquo;Ned Painter having been
subjected to the expense of wanton and persecuting litigation,
his friends intend giving him a benefit at the Pantheon, Royal
Victoria Gardens, on which occasion the Stars of the Fancy have
resolved to rally round and support an old and tried veteran of
the Prize Ring.&nbsp; Among the prominent professors of the
Pugilistic Art who will appear are Tom Spring, Champion of
England, and Ben Caunt, the modern champion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Great excitement was created in Norwich by the
conviction at the Assizes before Mr. Justice Coleridge, of John
Harper, a well-known auctioneer, on the charge of stealing cloth
entrusted to him for sale at North Walsham by a Leeds
manufacturer named Jonas Driver.&nbsp; Mr. S. Bignold, Mr.
Beckwith, solicitor; Mr. T. M. Keith, solicitor; the Rev. S.
Stone, the Rev. W. Hull, and other prominent citizens testified
<!-- page 427--><a name="page427"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
427</span>to the general honesty and integrity of the prisoner,
who, amid a strong manifestation of feeling in Court, was
sentenced to seven years&rsquo; transportation.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Mr. Cobden, M.P., Col. Thompson, and Mr. Moore,
representatives of the Anti-Corn Law League, addressed a large
meeting held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, under the presidency of
Mr. J. H. Tillett.&nbsp; A body of Chartists created some
disorder.&nbsp; On the 8th a meeting of farmers &ldquo;of the
most complete party complexion&rdquo; took place at the Hall,
when Mr. A. Morse, of Swaffham, &ldquo;author of one of the prize
essays of the League,&rdquo; presided, and addresses were
delivered by Mr. Cobden and his friends.&nbsp; The League at this
date was actively promulgating its principles in all parts of the
county.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;The ship Phya sailed from Lynn for Quebec, with
emigrants.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whilst the population keeps increasing,
and machinery keeps lessening the demand for manual labour, many
thousands must seek to provide for themselves and families in
distant regions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>20.&mdash;The construction of the Yarmouth and Norwich Railway
commenced on this date on the Postwick Hall Farm (in the
occupation of Mr. Gillett), near Thorpe Asylum.&nbsp; The
excavation of the New Cut from Trowse Hythe to Whitlingham Reach
was begun on May 6th.&nbsp; In October an engine with ballast
waggons was running between Reedham and Yarmouth; and in November
another engine appeared on the Postwick end of the line.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Its marvellous facility in whirling along any number of
loaded waggons elicited exclamations of astonishment from the
many hundreds of Norwich people who went out to see
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> April 12th, 1844.)</p>
<p>&mdash;In the waistband of the trousers of a notorious
housebreaker, named James Fisk, who was apprehended at Surlingham
on this date, &ldquo;was found sewed up the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer,
written backwards, which he carried about with him as a fancied
protection against the power of human law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;The marriage of the Earl of Leicester and Miss
Whitbread, daughter of Mr. S. C. Whitbread, at Cardington church,
Bedfordshire, was celebrated with great rejoicings at
Wells-next-the-Sea, where 800 school children were entertained,
and 1,400 of the poor inhabitants had dinner on the
Buttlands.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;At Norwich Theatre was performed a new drama,
entitled, &ldquo;Mokanna, or the Veiled Prophet of
Khorassan,&rdquo; written by Mr. William Cooper, barrister, and
originally produced at Lynn Theatre.&nbsp; An anonymous handbill,
printed by J. Fletcher, Upper Haymarket, Norwich, was afterwards
circulated, describing the play as a &ldquo;barefaced exhibition
of profligacy,&rdquo; and calling upon the citizens to denounce
it.&nbsp; The strictures were grossly unfair.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;The foundation-stone of St. Mark&rsquo;s church,
Lakenham, was laid by the Very Rev. Dean Pellew.&nbsp; The
architect was Mr. John Brown, and the builder Mr. James
Worman.&nbsp; The church was consecrated by the Bishop of Norwich
on September 24th, 1844.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;The two troops of the 13th Light Dragoons marched
from Norwich Barracks for Hounslow.&nbsp; They were replaced on

Mainly through the influence of the Duke of Wellington and the
Marquis of Douro, the headquarters of the regiment were stationed
at Norwich.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;At the Norwich Police Court, a woman named Kedge
complained to the magistrates that another woman, of the name of
Clarke, had bewitched her &ldquo;by sending her and her children
a vast number of vermin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Clarke replied that Mrs.
Kedge had harboured her (Mrs. Clarke&rsquo;s) husband, and had
given her a small piece of paper, whereon was very small
writing.&nbsp; It was found to be the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.&nbsp;
Mrs. Kedge acknowledged having given this to Mrs. Clarke, and
said it would &ldquo;prevent her from doing her further injury,
for when she had herself put it in defendant&rsquo;s hands, all
danger from witchery was over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>13.*&mdash;&ldquo;One day last week a steam coach, constructed
on a new principle, was tried at Witton, on the Yarmouth road,
before a large concourse of spectators, but although the steam
was put on, the coach would not move an inch.&nbsp; When pushed
it proceeded a short distance and stopped.&nbsp; The
experimenters at last lifted the coach from the road, when the
wheels went round with alarming velocity.&rdquo;&nbsp; On May
27th the carriage was advertised for sale by private contract, by
Mr. Joseph Emmerson Bane, at the King&rsquo;s Head Inn,
Blofield.</p>

Quarter Sessions, on July 17th, he was charged before the
Recorder, Mr. Martin J. West, with stealing &pound;4,362 1s. 6d.,
and, on pleading guilty, was sentenced to fourteen years&rsquo;
transportation.&nbsp; The Recorder expressed the hope that he
would not have to appear at the Assizes to answer the still more
serious charge of forgery.&nbsp; He was, however, indicted at the
Norfolk Assizes on August 3rd, on two counts, for forgery, and on
pleading guilty was sentenced by Baron Alderson to transportation
for life.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;For nearly three hours &ldquo;the sun was surrounded

performers with the Norwich Company, eloped from the city.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The attachment between the parties has been of long
standing, but it was opposed by the young lady&rsquo;s friends,
on account of the disparity of years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs.
Gill appeared at Yarmouth Theatre on September 8th.</p>
<p>&mdash;Died at North Walsham, Captain Thomas Withers, R.N.,

<p>8.&mdash;A whirlwind occurred at Blakeney.&nbsp; In its course
it carried away several yards of a wall two feet thick, took from
some smacks the hatchings, which were blown upon the marshes, and
blew a man off the seat of a threshing machine.&nbsp; The stable
at the White Horse was unroofed, and a quantity of Mr.

about witchcraft was told to the Norwich magistrates.&nbsp; Mr.
and Mrs. Curtis alleged that a Mrs. Bell had bewitched them three
days after Tombland Fair, and they had been bewitched ever
since.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Curtis saw Mrs. Bell light a candle and
fill it with pins.&nbsp; She then put some red dragon&rsquo;s
blood, with some water, into an oyster-shell, and having repeated
a form of words over it, her (Mr. Curtis&rsquo;) husband&rsquo;s
arms and legs were set fast, and when he lay down he could not
get up again without <!-- page 430--><a name="page430"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 430</span>somebody helping him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The man made a similar statement, and said that to the
dragon&rsquo;s blood and water Mrs. Bell added some parings of
her own nails, put the mixture over the fire, and muttered an
incantation.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;A young man named Robert Smithson &ldquo;wagered

many years the representative at Lynn of the <span

drama induced him, when he resided at Gaywood Hall, to become
lessee of Lynn Theatre, on the boards of which he occasionally
performed as an amateur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Norwich and many parts of the county were visited by
one of the severest thunderstorms that had occurred for many
years.&nbsp; It was accompanied by a hailstorm which did immense
damage&mdash;in the city windows and conservatories were smashed,
in the county garden and field crops were destroyed.&nbsp; The
first floors and cellars in Surrey Street, St. Stephen&rsquo;s
Street, Rampant Horse Street, the Market Place, and London Street
were flooded, and in places morsels of ice lay from four to five
inches deep.&nbsp; The storm lasted half an hour.&nbsp; The
performance at the Theatre was stopped, and the terrified
audience in the gallery rushed down the stairs and found the
passage filled with water, which prevented their escape.&nbsp;
The river at Bishop Bridge rose one foot in five minutes.&nbsp;
At two o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 10th, the rain and
hail again descended with great violence, and &ldquo;a surface of
flame spread across the heavens, followed by a clap of thunder
which seemed to rend the welkin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another storm
occurred on the 15th, and on the 18th waterspouts were observed
at Rushall and Dickleburgh.&nbsp; At a meeting at the
Bishop&rsquo;s Palace on the 19th, steps were taken for the
relief of the sufferers, a public subscription organized, and
surveyors appointed to assess the damage.&nbsp; In September the

summoned for unlawfully taking toll in respect of a vehicle
called a &ldquo;wheel machine,&rdquo; interesting particulars
were given of the contrivance, which belonged to a Norwich
mechanic named Matthew Fish.&nbsp; It was described as
&ldquo;only a barrow worked by the feet, and not propelled by
machinery.&rdquo;&nbsp; The carriage was shown outside the Court,
and &ldquo;appeared to be a very ingenious machine, which could
be worked at the rate of ten miles an hour on a level
road.&rdquo;&nbsp; It had three wheels and two levers.&nbsp; Mr.
Repton, the clerk to the turnpike trustees, urged that the narrow
wheels cut up the road more than those of heavy carriages, and
that <i>such contrivances for evading toll and the keeping of
horses were increasing</i>.&nbsp; These carriages were considered
a nuisance on the roads, no horses liked to pass them, and the
Act laid a heavy toll upon them to prevent them running on any
turnpike at all.&nbsp; The matter was ultimately settled without
a conviction.</p>

Norwich Theatre with his trained lions, &amp;c., in a drama

Richard Warburton Lytton, of Knebworth Park, Herts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was mother of the Ambassador at Madrid, of Sir Edward,
who succeeds to the estates, and of Mr. W. L. Bulwer, of Heydon
Hall.&nbsp; The literary tastes and accomplishments of Mrs.
Bulwer Lytton may have had an influence in early life upon her
son&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Many poems of hers circulated amongst her
immediate friends are full of feeling and grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The report on the Christmas trade at Norwich stated

George Colegate.&nbsp; When the case was heard in the Arches
Court, counsel for Mr. Francis protested that upon the face of
the citation it did not appear that he had been guilty of any
ecclesiastical offence cognisable by the Court, neither did it
appear that the parish church was in need of repair.&nbsp; These
arguments <!-- page 434--><a name="page434"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 434</span>were overruled by the Court,
whereupon Mr. Francis took the case to the Court of Queen&rsquo;s
Bench, and on May 9th Mr. Justice Denman delivered judgment in
favour of the appellant, on the ground that the citation was bad,
because of there being no adequate allegation of any spiritual
offence.</p>

governess of the clink.&nbsp; She leaves no relative or friend to

repose) from the fury of the pelting storm.&rdquo;</p>

having, on November 17th, 1843, &ldquo;assisted Mr. Charles
Edward Overman and 20 other persons in the taking of a hare by
means of two greyhounds, the said act of assisting not being done
in the company or presence and for the use of any person who had
then duly obtained a certificate in his own right and who then
and there used his own dogs for the taking of the said
hare,&rdquo; whereby he rendered himself liable to a penalty of
&pound;20.&nbsp; Evidence was adduced showing that the dogs which
ran at the West Burnham Coursing Meeting, where the alleged
offence took place, belonged to qualified persons.&nbsp; The
Bench recorded a conviction, against which the defendant
appealed, at the Norfolk Quarter Sessions, held at Norwich on
March 13th.&nbsp; The Court quashed the conviction.&nbsp; Twenty
other cases depended upon the result of this appeal.</p>

support he entered into business as a publisher, in
Piccadilly.&nbsp; He was the particular friend of Gifford, the
poet, and the <i>rencontre</i> between that individual and Peter
Pindar took place at Wright&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; He was
afterwards connected with Cobbett in the publication of the
&ldquo;Weekly Register,&rdquo; but this terminated in a lawsuit,
in which the latter gained little credit.&nbsp; Literary pursuits

All the local dancing masters advertised it, and it gave fresh
life and animation to the ball rooms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing was

<p>24.*&mdash;&ldquo;The operation of Lord Brougham&rsquo;s Act,
for the abolition of imprisonment for debt, has had the effect of
clearing the Norwich Gaol of all the debtors except one.&nbsp;
Its operation will be very disadvantageous to the prisoners
sentenced by the Court of Conscience or Requests, as they had
laid a part of their time, and a very few days more would have
exempted them from future liability, whereas now they go out
subject to other proceedings and executions against their
goods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>25.&mdash;The <span class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span>
published the results of an inquiry into the state of the
manufactures of Norwich, and in its comments stated:
&ldquo;Norwich has lost its former prominence as a manufacturing
city, partly in consequence of the high price of coals compared
with the North and West, and partly from improvements in
machinery being tardily introduced.&nbsp; We regret that while
8,000 persons are employed in or connected with our factories and
mills, a large number are constantly without work, and this is
likely to be the state of things for some time to
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&mdash;On this date occurred the highest tide ever recorded

at the battle of Maida, and distinguished himself on other

Prince of Orange, and was subsequently upon the personal staff of
the Duke of Wellington.&nbsp; For his services during this

<p>26.&mdash;At a meeting of the Norfolk and Norwich Shipwrecked
Mariners&rsquo; Society, held at the Shirehall, Norwich, Mr. J.
J. Gurney called attention to a new form of life-preserver made
and presented to the society by a reporter of the <span
class="smcap">Norfolk Chronicle</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;It consists
of a linen jacket covered with oblong pieces of cork.&nbsp; The
head is put through a circle, and the jacket falls down at the
back and the front of the person wearing it, leaving the arms
perfectly free, being suspended from the shoulders and strapped
round the body.&nbsp; There is a semi-circular thick cork collar
in front and coming under the chin, so that the jacket is not
only calculated to keep any person afloat in the water, but also
to keep his head at a sufficient elevation.&nbsp; It was agreed
that the jacket should become the property of the
society.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;An appalling loss of life was occasioned at Yarmouth
by the fall of the Suspension Bridge, which had been the subject
of so much litigation between Mr. Cory and the Yarmouth and
Norwich Railway Company.&nbsp; A clown named Nelson, belonging to
Cooke&rsquo;s Equestrian Circus, had announced that he would
perform the feat of sailing in a tub drawn by four geese from the
old Draw Bridge to the Suspension Bridge.&nbsp; Thousands of
persons assembled to witness the spectacle, and upon the bridge
itself there were between 400 and 500.&nbsp; The bridge, which
was the chief means of transit from the railway terminus to the
town, and had been widened to admit of increased traffic by a
footpath constructed on either side, was suspended from two
piers.&nbsp; Just as the clown was entering the Bure, at ten
minutes to six o&rsquo;clock, there was a rush to the south side
of the bridge, the suspension rods snapped, the chains gave way,
and &ldquo;the bridge fell on that side like the leaf of a table
let down,&rdquo; pouring the crowd upon it into the water.&nbsp;
A terrible scene ensued.&nbsp; As many as possible were rescued
and conveyed to the Vauxhall Gardens, but notwithstanding the
efforts made by watermen in boats and upon the river banks, there
was fearful loss of life.&nbsp; An inquest was opened at the
Church Hall on the 3rd, when Mr. Cooke, the proprietor of the
circus, intimated that he would at once withdraw his company from
the town.&nbsp; The inquiry was adjourned from time to time, and
at the last sitting Mr. James Walker, C.E., who had been sent
down to examine into the cause of the disaster, reported: (1) the
immediate cause of the accident was a defect in the welding of
the bar which first gave way; (2) that the quality of the iron
and the workmanship were defective, and the accident would not
have happened had the work been properly examined at the time of
construction; (3) the widening of the bridge appeared to have
been made without sufficient <!-- page 447--><a
name="page447"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 447</span>reference
to its original strength and the weight which it had to support;
and (4) that in the original construction of the bridge the
casualty of a great load all on one side did not appear to have
been contemplated.&nbsp; The jury returned a verdict in
accordance with Mr. Walker&rsquo;s conclusions.&nbsp; The number
of dead bodies recovered was 77; some, however, were supposed to
have been carried away by the current.&nbsp; Nearly all the
sufferers were children or very young persons, but it was related
as &ldquo;a very extraordinary circumstance&rdquo; that
&ldquo;Mr. Thomas Bowles, aged 84, who was on board the Royal
George when she sank, and who is probably the only living
survivor, should have been on the Suspension Bridge during the
late accident.&nbsp; He was precipitated into the water, but was
once more miraculously saved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>10.*&mdash;&ldquo;A handbill has been published in Norwich
showing that out of 1,664 persons who have had small-pox, 1,536
had not been vaccinated, and only 128 were vaccinated.&nbsp; Out
of 506 who had escaped the disease altogether, only 84 had not
been vaccinated, and 422 vaccinated.&nbsp; Of 141 who had died
from small-pox, only four had been vaccinated, one a man 93 years
old; the other three were suffering from teething or were
otherwise ill when vaccinated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>26.&mdash;A series of lectures on phonography was commenced at
the Assembly Rooms, Norwich, by Mr. Joseph Pitman and Mr.

&ldquo;Foreign Airs and Native Graces,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; At
the conclusion of the season, on the 26th, Mr. George Smith
announced to the audience that he had resigned the management of
the circuit.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had been,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;thirty-one years a member of the Norwich Company.&nbsp; He
had witnessed the drama in its high and palmy state; he had seen
its gradual decline.&nbsp; Many had been the causes assigned for
this decay&mdash;the increase of Dissent and fanaticism on the
one hand, errors of management on the other, and the reduction of
prices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>29.&mdash;A prize-fight took place on Mousehold Heath,
Norwich, between Jim Woods and Ben Clarke, &ldquo;the Norfolk
Slasher,&rdquo; for &pound;5 a side.&nbsp; Woods was the
favourite, at 5 to 2, and obtained &ldquo;first blood,&rdquo; but
in the second round Clarke struck him a severe blow on the temple
and felled him.&nbsp; In the third round Clarke put in another
blow, and as his opponent was falling, struck him behind the ear
and laid him senseless.&nbsp; Clarke was declared the winner,
after a contest which lasted only five minutes.</p>
<p>&mdash;The Norfolk Railway was opened.&nbsp; The directors ran
a special train from Trowse to Cambridge, by which about 200
guests, including the Dean and Mayor of Norwich, were
conveyed.&nbsp; A special train from London brought a like
contingent to Cambridge, where luncheon was served, under the
presidency of the chairman of the Eastern Counties Railway, Mr.
Henry Bosanquet.&nbsp; One of the first projects for a long line
was the proposal to construct a railway between London and
Norwich, <i>via</i> Thetford, with a continuation to
Yarmouth.&nbsp; A prospectus was printed and partially circulated
in 1825, but the scheme was abandoned.&nbsp; In 1835 the
prospectus of the Eastern Counties (or Grand Eastern Counties)
Railway appeared.&nbsp; The requisite notices were published in
November of that year, application was made in the ensuing
session of Parliament for a Bill, and the first Act for the
construction of the works received the Royal assent on July 4th,
1836.&nbsp; Up to 1840 this line was opened only as far as Warley
Lane, between Brentwood and Warley Common.&nbsp; In 1843 it was
completed as far as Colchester, but as the original capital was
more than expended in carrying the line that distance, all hope
of proceeding to Norwich was abandoned.&nbsp; In 1839 two Acts
connected with the Northern and Western Company were passed, and
received the Royal assent on July 19th.&nbsp; The first was for
the purpose of extending the time for the purchase of land as far
as Bishop&rsquo;s Stortford, and the second was chiefly to
confirm an agreement with the Eastern Counties Company as to the
terms, &amp;c., for passing over their line.&nbsp; In 1840
another Act was passed, receiving the Royal assent on June 4th,
for reducing the joint stock capital to &pound;700,000, giving
the company power to raise &pound;240,000 on debentures so soon
as one moiety of the capital should be paid off, and abandoning
that portion of the line between Bishop&rsquo;s Stortford and
Cambridge.&nbsp; In 1840 the idea of railway communication
between Norwich and the Metropolis was revived, and it was
resolved to form a company, to be styled the Norfolk, Suffolk,
and Cambridge Railway Company.&nbsp; It was afterwards known as
the East Anglian Railway Company.&nbsp; It received the support
of the landowners&rsquo; committee in Norfolk, and the expense
was estimated as follows: From Bishop&rsquo;s Stortford to
Cambridge, 22 miles, &pound;572,000; from Cambridge to Norwich,
63 miles, &pound;1,126,695; from Norwich to Yarmouth, 18 miles,
&pound;291,512.&nbsp; After the opening of the Yarmouth and
Norwich <!-- page 449--><a name="page449"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 449</span>line according to the plan of Mr.
Stephenson, the project for the East Anglian Railway was dropped
for a time, and was revived by the promoters of the Norwich and
Brandon Railway, the prospectus of which was published in
1843.&nbsp; The capital to be raised was stated to be
&pound;380,000, in 19,000 shares of &pound;20 each.&nbsp; In the
Session of 1844 an Act was applied for and received the Royal
assent in the month of June.&nbsp; The line in connection with
that from Yarmouth and with that from Ely to Brandon resulted,
and it was known as the Norfolk Railway.&nbsp; Messrs. Grissell
and Peto were the contractors, and Messrs. Stephenson and Bidder
the engineers in chief.&nbsp; The works were commenced at
Wymondham on May 17th, 1844, and finished on July 1st,
1845.&nbsp; The first through train to London started from Trowse
on the morning of July 30th.&nbsp; At that date the swing bridge
at Trowse had not been completed.&nbsp; Of the travelling it was
said it &ldquo;cannot be rendered more comfortable than it is
upon the Norfolk Railway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>16.*&mdash;&ldquo;Within the last few days no less than 500
coach horses have been sent for sale at Aldridge&rsquo;s

Marylebone Club and the Norfolk Club, and concluded on the

the side did little to retrieve the misfortune.&rdquo;&nbsp;

three seasons has been a general favourite on the Norwich
circuit, has accepted an engagement at the Prince&rsquo;s
Theatre, London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;*&ldquo;The North Walsham Theatre, which eighteen years
ago cost Mr. D. Fisher &pound;1,800, has lately been sold for

Jeremiah Colman appointed Sheriff.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;Died, aged 72, Gregory Robinson, of the Bull&rsquo;s
Head Inn, Ber Street, Norwich.&nbsp; &ldquo;The deceased in early
life entered the Navy, and was with Lord Howe on June 1st, 1794,
and in several other engagements.&nbsp; He was one of the crew of
the St. George when that vessel was wrecked on the coast of
Jutland, on December 24th, 1811.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;A public meeting was held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall,
Norwich, to consider the propriety of memorialising the
Government to open the ports of Great Britain and Ireland for the
admission of foreign grain free of duty, in consequence of the
apprehended scarcity of food.&nbsp; The Mayor presided, and Mr.
Tillett moved that a petition be presented to Parliament for the
immediate repeal of the Corn Laws.&nbsp; A similar petition was
adopted by the Norwich Town Council on the 9th.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;In the Arches Court, Sir H. Jenner Fust gave
judgment in the suit Kitson <i>v.</i> the Rev. Arthur Loftus,
vicar of Fincham St. Martin and rector of Fincham St.
Michael.&nbsp; The case came before the Court by letters of
request from the Bishop of Norwich, and the articles, in
substance, charged Mr. Loftus with gross immorality.&nbsp;
Sentence of deprivation was passed.</p>
<p>&mdash;A &ldquo;remarkable and unprecedented&rdquo; occurrence
took place at the meet, on Mulbarton Common, of the Norfolk
Subscription Pack of Staghounds.&nbsp; A bailiff, on behalf of
the Rev. J. H. Steward, of Carlton House, served notices upon all
who were suspected of being about to commit a trespass.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The eccentricity of such a proceeding created much
amusement, and the consequence was a change of position was
ordered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>22.&mdash;The van of a menagerie travelling through Potter
Heigham overturned into a ditch, and the bars of the
tiger&rsquo;s cage giving way, &ldquo;the animal escaped, after
biting off the head of an eagle.&rdquo;&nbsp; The neighbouring
farmers, armed with guns, and the labourers with pitchforks, went
in pursuit of the beast.&nbsp; An unsuccessful endeavour was made
to entangle him in a sheep-net.&nbsp; &ldquo;A large hamper
containing a piece of flesh was then placed in his way.&nbsp;
Upon his jumping in to seize the food the lid was drawn down and
soon secured, the animal uttering the most hideous
yells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>24.&mdash;A serious accident occurred on the Norfolk Railway
near Thetford.&nbsp; The up-train from Norwich was proceeding at
a rapid rate when the engine left the line and fell down the
embankment.&nbsp; The engine-driver, named Pickering, was killed
instantly, and the stoker, Richard Eager, had both legs broken,
and died shortly after his removal from the scene of the
accident.&nbsp; None of the passengers were seriously hurt.&nbsp;
The accident was supposed to be due to the excessive speed at
which the train was travelling&mdash;fifty-five miles an
hour.</p>

452</span>26.&mdash;Norwich Theatre was opened, under the
management of Mr. Abington, M.A., lessee of Southampton
Theatre.&nbsp; The circuit also included the Cambridge, Bury St.
Edmund&rsquo;s, Ipswich, Colchester, and Yarmouth Theatres.&nbsp;
The old company had been dispersed, and regret was expressed that
the new company was not likely to maintain the reputation of the
Norwich stage.</p>
<p>31.&mdash;The customary peals were rung at St. Peter Mancroft,
Norwich.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the centre of the circle stood the
celebrated pitcher, capable of holding seventeen quarts, which
was moulded by John Dearsley in the year 1749.&nbsp; This the
churchwardens (Mr. W. Butcher and Mr. Robert Fitch) liberally
filled with punch.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>JANUARY.</h4>
<p>6.&mdash;The West Norfolk Agricultural Protective Association
held a meeting at the Town Hall, King&rsquo;s Lynn, under the
presidency of Lord Hastings, &ldquo;to preserve the Corn Laws
from further violation.&rdquo;&nbsp; A similar meeting was held
at North Walsham on the 8th.&nbsp; On January 20th a great
meeting took place at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich, at which
addresses were delivered by Mr. Cobden and Col. Thompson in
favour of the repeal of the Corn Laws, and a resolution, moved by
Mr. Geary, and seconded by Col. Angerstein, &ldquo;that the Corn
Laws and all other laws designed to restrict trade under pretence
of protecting particular classes are unjust in principle and
injurious in operation, and ought to be forthwith
abolished,&rdquo; was carried by a large majority, in face of an
amendment proposed by Mr. Wodehouse, M.P., and supported by Lord
Hastings, Mr. Hamond of Westacre, and other prominent
Protectionists.&nbsp; &ldquo;Reporters from all the London daily
papers attended the meeting, and the proprietors engaged special
trains to carry back the report of the proceedings.&nbsp; The
first special left Norwich Station at 8.45 p.m., and reached
Shoreditch at 12.40 a.m.; the second left at 10.29 p.m. and
reached London at 2.38 a.m.&nbsp; At half-past two p.m. on
Wednesday (the 21st) we received the &lsquo;Times&rsquo;
containing the speeches to the extent of rather more than four
columns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Died at Malta, aged 77, the Right Hon. John Hookham
Frere, of Roydon Hall, eldest son of Mr. John Frere, formerly
member for Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. Hookham Frere was educated at Eton,
where he had Canning as a school companion.&nbsp; When very young
he evinced a love for verse, and made, when only an Eton school
boy, his clever translation of the Anglo-Saxon War Song on the
victory of Athelstan, written when the Rowley controversy was at
its height.&nbsp; George Ellis gave it a place in his historical
essay before his &ldquo;Specimens of the Poets,&rdquo; and Scott
invariably spoke of it as something more than a mere
curiosity.&nbsp; Another of Mr. Frere&rsquo;s works was a
&ldquo;prospectus and specimen&rdquo; of his &ldquo;Intended
National Work by William and Robert Whistlecraft of Stowmarket in
Suffolk, Hemp and Collar Makers, intended to comprise the most
interesting particulars relating to King Arthur and his Round

Byron&rsquo;s &ldquo;Beppo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Don
Juan.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have written,&rdquo; says Byron,
&ldquo;a poem of 84 octave stanzas, in or after the excellent
manner of Mr. Whistlecraft, whom I take to be Mr.
Frere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>17.*&mdash;&ldquo;All the coaches between Norwich and London
have ceased to run, the last being the mail through Bury St.
Edmund&rsquo;s, which was discontinued on the 6th inst.&nbsp; Six
or seven coaches direct to London from Norfolk have been
discontinued, and about 700 horses thrown off the road.&nbsp;
There are, however, about 30 coaches constantly running from
various towns to the principal stations between Yarmouth and
London.&nbsp; There are many omnibuses, cabs, and flys.&nbsp; The
railway has very much increased the number of horse conveyances
to and from all the towns along the line.&nbsp; In fact, horses
are dearer than ever they were and more in demand, and the
consumption of oats is not likely to be diminished, but rather
increased.&rdquo;&nbsp; The adverse effects of the railway were
shown in the following paragraph, published on April 25th:
&ldquo;During the droving season last year 9,300 beasts were
housed at the Bird-in-Hand public-house, Tasburgh, and the
landlord purchased for their consumption, and for horses,
&amp;c., 50 tons of hay; but so great is the diminution of the
traffic occasioned by the Norfolk Railway, that during the
present season only twelve beasts have been taken in, and the
landlord has had occasion for only eight and a half hundredweight
of hay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>21.&mdash;The Norwich School of Design was opened by Sir J. P.
Boileau, Bart.</p>
<p>31.*&mdash;&ldquo;By order of the Mayor and magistrates of
Norwich, the shop-keepers have had notice that no goods are to be
exposed or sold after ten o&rsquo;clock on Sunday morning, and
bakers are not to sell or bake goods after half-past one
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several tradesmen
were afterwards charged before the magistrates for contravention
of the order.</p>
<h4>FEBRUARY.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;A large sea-borne vessel, heavily laden with coal,
and between 60 and 70 tons burden, was brought up to the head of
the navigation at Norwich, the first vessel of the kind that had
ever got beyond Foundry Bridge.&nbsp; It was a Dutch-built craft,
drawing only two feet of water, and was the property of Messrs.
Bullard and Watts, St. Michael-at-Coslany Bridge.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;Mr. D. N. Fisher gave the first of three subscription
concerts at the Assembly Rooms, Norwich.&nbsp; The
<i>artistes</i> included Mdlle. Schloss, Madame and Signor F.
Lablache, Mr. W. L. Phillips (principal violoncello), Mr. D. N.
Fisher (leader), Mr. William Sterndale Bennett (director), and
Mr. James Harcourt (director of rehearsals).&nbsp; &ldquo;The
musical world of Norwich owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Fisher
for introducing to them Mr. William Sterndale Bennett.&nbsp; As a
pianist, Mr. Bennett, without the extravagance and with less fire
and brilliance than Liszt, has all the expression and musical
enthusiasm of that performer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>27.&mdash;At the Norfolk Assizes, before Mr. Justice Maule,
Samuel Yarham was indicted for the murder of Harriet Candler, at
Yarmouth, on November 18th, 1844.&nbsp; The prisoner, who at the
Spring Assizes in 1845 turned Queen&rsquo;s evidence against
three other men (Hall, Mapes, and Royal) charged with the murder,
had made certain admissions which led to his apprehension at
Gloucester, where he had gone to work.&nbsp; The jury found him
guilty, and he was sentenced to death.&nbsp; The execution took
place on the Castle Hill, Norwich, on April 11th (Tombland
Fair-day), in the presence of 30,000 spectators.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Eight hundred persons came from Wymondham in one train; it
was found necessary to use bullock-trucks to convey the people,
there not being a sufficient number of regular
carriages.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fancy fair (the Sick Poor Repository)
and all business in the city was suspended during the
morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;After the execution, gongs, drums, and
other instruments commenced their uproar, mountebanks and clowns
their antics, the vendors of wares and exhibitors of prodigies
their cries, while the whirligigs and ups-and-downs were soon in
full swing.&nbsp; The public-houses round the Hill were crowded,
and hundreds finished the day in riot and intoxication.&nbsp;
Royal and Hall were on the Hill during the execution, and got
jostled by the crowd.&nbsp; They were turned out of the Golden
Ball public-house and other houses where they presented
themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Owing to the scandalous character of the
proceedings, a public meeting was held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall
on April 17th, under the presidency of the Mayor, when it was
decided to petition Parliament for the abolition of capital
punishment.</p>
<h4>APRIL.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;The first general meeting of the Norfolk and Norwich
Arch&aelig;ological Society was held at the Norfolk and Norwich
Museum, under the presidency of the Lord Bishop of Norwich.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;Died at his residence at Lakenham, aged 81, Mr.
Thomas Thurtell, formerly an Alderman of Norwich, who served the
office of Sheriff in 1815, and of Mayor in 1828.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
was universally esteemed as an honest and upright
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i> April 30th.)</p>
<p>11.&mdash;George Clarke, a Norwich pedestrian, commenced a
walk of 1,500 miles in 1,000 successive hours, &ldquo;a mile and
a half at the beginning of each hour,&rdquo; at the West End
Retreat Gardens, Norwich.&nbsp; (The result was not
recorded.)</p>
<p>16.&mdash;The Rev. R. F. Elwin, of Norwich, was presented with
a silver coffee service, in recognition of &ldquo;his promotion
of the objects of the Norfolk and Norwich Musical Festival from
its institution, in 1824.&rdquo;</p>
<p>18.&mdash;The 7th Hussars left Norwich for Ipswich, where they
joined headquarters and marched for Hounslow.&nbsp; They were
succeeded by the 6th Dragoon Guards (Carabineers), with
headquarters and staff.&nbsp; &ldquo;This regiment received its
<i>nom de guerre</i> from being the first corps which carried the
modern carbine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>20.&mdash;The Norwich Board of Health was established as a
permanent institution at a meeting held at the Guildhall.&nbsp;
Among its objects was <!-- page 455--><a name="page455"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 455</span>the encouragement of vaccination
amongst the poor.&nbsp; The Bishop of Norwich was elected
president, and the Mayor vice-president.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;Many hundreds of persons attended a steeplechase
meeting at East Dereham.&nbsp; &ldquo;The course from the Common
was marked out by flags describing a circle round the country,
over Mr. Greenacre&rsquo;s piece, across Mr. Neale&rsquo;s land,
and round to the Common again, making a distance of three and a
half miles in two rounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;The first stone of the Cromer sea-wall was laid by the
vicar, the Rev. W. Sharp, in the presence of the Earl and
Countess of Carnarvon and Lord Porchester.&nbsp; The contractors
were Messrs. Wright and Cattermole, of Norwich, and the engineer
Mr. J. Wright, of Westminster.&nbsp; On the same day the first
pile of the new jetty was driven.&nbsp; The works were opened
amid much festivity on August 7th.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;The North Cove Hall estates were sold at the Norfolk
Hotel, Norwich, by Mr. Simpson, for &pound;36,960.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;At a meeting of &ldquo;The Friends of Permanent and
Universal Peace,&rdquo; held at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Norwich,
under the presidency of Mr. J. J. Gurney, it was resolved:
&ldquo;That in consideration of the points now at issue between
this country and the United States of America, involving, as they
do, the question of war or peace, an address be presented to the
magistrates and to the ministers of the several denominations of
the city of Norwich in Connecticut, and generally to the people
of the United States, asking them to use their endeavours to
avert war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>30.&mdash;At the Norwich Police Court, Mr. George Thurtell,
horticulturist, was charged with assaulting a Mr. Riches, of St.
George Colegate.&nbsp; Mr. Riches was the Norwich correspondent
of the &ldquo;Daily News,&rdquo; and he had sent to that journal
a notice of Mr. Thomas Thurtell&rsquo;s death &ldquo;and a
private communication respecting one of Mr. Thurtell&rsquo;s
sons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. George Thurtell was greatly incensed on
seeing the paragraph, more particularly as his father was not
dead at the time, although he had been ill for some weeks, and
meeting the complainant in the Market Place, he severely
chastised him with a whip.&nbsp; The Bench, who considered the
paragraph highly improper, imposed upon the defendant the nominal
fine of one shilling.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> January 5th, 1848.)</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>8.&mdash;The Norfolk Yeomanry Cavalry commenced eight
days&rsquo; permanent duty at Cromer.</p>
<p>9.*&mdash;&ldquo;During the last week as many as 18 seaborne
vessels, <i>via</i> Lowestoft, many of them of considerable
burden, have been lying at Foundry Bridge, Norwich, laden with
coke, coals, and other materials, for delivery at the railway
station.&nbsp; This proves how excellent and how practical was
the plan of our late fellow-citizen, Mr. Crisp Brown, and must
cause universal regret that it then failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>18.&mdash;An inquest was opened at Happisburgh by Mr. Pilgrim,
one of the County Coroners, upon the bodies of Jonathan Balls,
his wife, and four grandchildren, who were believed to have been
poisoned.&nbsp; The bodies had been exhumed, and were placed in a
tent erected in the churchyard; peace officers were sworn to
prevent the incensed villagers <!-- page 456--><a
name="page456"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 456</span>from
rushing into the tent.&nbsp; Several other bodies were
disinterred, and in nearly every instance traces of arsenic were
found.&nbsp; At the adjourned inquiry some curious facts were
elicited.&nbsp; Suspicion pointed to Balls as having destroyed
his wife and grandchildren, and then poisoned himself.&nbsp; His
conduct years previously had been suspicious, children having
died suddenly while at his house.&nbsp; What number of persons
had been thus destroyed it was impossible to ascertain.&nbsp; The
jury found that, in the majority of the cases, death resulted
from the effects of poison, but how it was administered there was
no evidence to show.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;The bells of St. Peter Mancroft, Norwich, were rung
on the reception of the news of the birth, on the previous day,
of a Princess (Princess Helena Augusta Victoria).</p>
<p>31.&mdash;Died at Kimberley Hall, in his 76th year, the Right
Hon. John Baron Wodehouse.&nbsp; He was born January 11th, 1771,
and married November 18th, 1796, Charlotte Laura, only child and
heiress of Mr. John Norris, of Witton Park.&nbsp; He succeeded to
the peerage on the death of his father in 1834.&nbsp; He was made
Lord Lieutenant of the county and Vice-Admiral of the coast in
the room of Lord Suffield in 1821, and he had also served as
Colonel of the East Norfolk Militia, and was Steward of Norwich
Cathedral.&nbsp; His lordship was succeeded in his title and
estates by his grandson, John Gurdon Wodehouse, son of Henry
Wodehouse and of Anne, only daughter of Mr. T. T. Gurdon.&nbsp;
The deceased nobleman was a staunch Conservative.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
was of commanding appearance, both in personal figure and dignity
of deportment.&nbsp; During the contest for the representation of
Norfolk in 1806 it was remarked with perfect truth that three
finer men or more perfect gentlemen than Mr. Windham, Mr. Coke,
and Col. Wodehouse never presented themselves together as
candidates for the electoral suffrages of a great
county.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;A fire occurred at St. James&rsquo;s Factory,
Norwich.&nbsp; Upwards of one thousand persons were, in
consequence, thrown out of employment.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;The first meeting of a new archery society, known as
the West Norfolk Bowmen, of which Sir William B. ffolkes was
&ldquo;Prime Warden,&rdquo; and Lady ffolkes &ldquo;Lady
Patroness,&rdquo; was held at Reffley Wood, near King&rsquo;s
Lynn.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;The first excursion train from London arrived at
Norwich.&nbsp; It conveyed 800 passengers, who left Shoreditch at
one p.m., and reached Norwich at eight p.m.&nbsp; The first
excursion train from Yarmouth to London was run on June
29th.&nbsp; &ldquo;There were 1,500 persons when it left Trowse
Station at a quarter to nine, in 37 carriages.&nbsp; The
passengers had increased to 2,000, and the carriages to 52,
before it reached London, at 5.15 p.m.&rdquo;&nbsp; The return
fare was 7s. 6d.&nbsp; On June 30th 6,000 passengers were
conveyed by two special cheap trains to Yarmouth and back.&nbsp;
Hundreds of Nonconformist Sunday School children were taken at
threepence a head, and the return fare for ordinary passengers
was one shilling.&nbsp; Ten thousand persons assembled at Thorpe
Station to witness the return of the excursionists.</p>
<h4><!-- page 457--><a name="page457"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 457</span>JULY.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;A cricket match was played on the Norwich Ground,
between eleven resident members of the Norwich Club and the
Messrs. Colman (eleven brothers).&nbsp; In the first innings the
club headed their opponents by five runs only, and in the second
innings had 50 runs to get.&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock, when
the wickets were drawn, they had obtained 22 runs for four
wickets.&nbsp; Scores: The Messrs. Colman, 87-54; the Club,
92-22.&nbsp; Game unfinished.&nbsp; The following were the
Colmans:&mdash;Samuel, Joseph, William, Barnard, Thomas,
Jeremiah, Henry, Edward, James, Robert, and John.</p>
<p>4.&mdash;The great heat on this day so affected the iron Swing
Bridge at Trowse as to prevent its being opened for the
accommodation of the river traffic.&nbsp; At the magisterial
proceedings which followed, it was urged in defence that the heat
caused the ironwork to expand.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;The first direct communication from Norwich to London
was made through the medium of the electric telegraph.</p>
<p>&mdash;An experimental trip from London to Rotterdam was made
by the railway company, <i>via</i> Norwich and Yarmouth.&nbsp;
The railway journey was performed in 3 hrs. 35 mins. 15 secs.,
and was more successful than the trip by the steamer known as the
Norfolk.&nbsp; On the return voyage the crew were under the
influence of drink, bad weather was experienced, and the vessel
got out of her course.&nbsp; The boiler of the engine of the
return train to London burst when a mile and a half from Ely, and
the excursionists alighted from the carriages and walked to that
city.&nbsp; The Norfolk afterwards plied regularly between
Yarmouth and Rotterdam.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;Died, Charlotte Elizabeth, wife of Mr. Lewis Tonna
and only daughter of the Rev. Michael Browne, Minor Canon of
Norwich Cathedral.&nbsp; She edited &ldquo;The Christian
Ladies&rsquo; Magazine,&rdquo; and was the author of
&ldquo;Letters from Ireland,&rdquo; and of many religious
works.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;Norwich Theatre was opened, under the management of

miles <!-- page 460--><a name="page460"></a><span

cheaper and quicker.&nbsp; It would be a great advantage in this
and other counties if a general Act were passed for widening and
levelling the turnpike roads and for laying down tramways on
which carriages could be drawn by horses or by engines of small
power to the principal railway.&nbsp; Unless some measure of this
sort be carried out, the common roads will soon be of little use,
and not worth keeping in repair.&rdquo;</p>

Tillett rose from his seat and described the lecture as &ldquo;a
mass of rhodomontade, as an imposition, as non-conclusive, and as

lecturing on heads, and asked what would be thought if he brought
down a phrenologist to lecture on the heads of his
opponents?&rdquo;</p>

the vacant see of Norwich on the death of Bishop Bathurst in
1837.&nbsp; &ldquo;His lordship was a Liberal in politics, but
more of the Whig than the Radical, and although too conciliatory
to Dissenters, he, of late years in particular, showed himself
devoutedly attached to the Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was Clerk of
the Closet to the Queen, President of the Linnean Society, and
one of the Commissioners appointed in 1848 to enquire into the
state of the British Museum.</p>

ministers in the performance of religious worship at the Wesleyan
chapel, Cawston.&nbsp; The affidavits read disclosed a number of

defending the rights of the present Water Works Company and of
opposing the new Water Works Bill in Parliament.&rdquo;&nbsp; On

at the Norfolk Assizes, before Lord Chief Baron Pollock.&nbsp;
The question at issue was the right to the use of the stream
which worked Taverham Mills.&nbsp; The defendants manufactured
the paper for &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; newspaper, &ldquo;and <!--

terrestrial globe, and were to be found in every corner of the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; In order to carry on their business, the
defendants had the right to raise the stream behind their mills;
they had not only raised it to the height they were entitled to
enjoy, but very much higher; so high that they had flooded the
lands of Mr. Thomas Trench Berney, and had rendered them useless
for sheep grazing.&nbsp; The case was ultimately referred to Mr.

account of the damage laid in the declaration, subject to such
reference.</p>

Guildhall, on condition that the Corporation removed the false
ceiling in the Council Chamber and laid open the old roof, it was
unanimously resolved to accept the clock.&nbsp; It was made by
Messrs. Moore, of Clerkenwell, London, and fixed in a turret
designed by Mr. Kerr, in the month of October.</p>
<p>30.&mdash;The headquarters of the 16th Lancers marched from
Norwich for Hounslow.</p>
<h4>MAY.</h4>
<p>1.&mdash;Sultzer&rsquo;s public baths were opened in St.
Augustine&rsquo;s, Norwich.&nbsp; In the course of six months
they were used by 10,943 persons.</p>
<p>4.&mdash;Attention was directed to the system then becoming
more prevalent than ever, of driving dogs in trucks or small
carts along the public roads.&nbsp; &ldquo;To say nothing of the
cruelty to the dogs, few horses will pass them without risk of
accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6.&mdash;The season terminated at Norwich Theatre.&nbsp; The
house was under the management of Mr. Clarence (afterwards known
as Mr. Clarence Holt).</p>
<p>14.&mdash;The Norwich Town Council adopted an address of

days.</p>
<p>&mdash;A sturgeon, measuring 6 ft. 2 in. in length and 3 ft. 6
in. in girth, and weighing 15 st. 3 lbs., was shot in the river
Wissey, near Hilgay Bridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is surprising how a
fish of this size could get up the river so far, as it had to
pass through several sluices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>17.&mdash;Died at Mill Hill, Hendon, aged 57, Sir James
Flower, Bart.&nbsp; He was a son of the first baronet, by the
eldest daughter and co-heiress of Mr. James Squire, of
Portsmouth.&nbsp; In 1816 he married the daughter of Sir Walter
Stirling, Bart.&nbsp; He succeeded his father in 1834.&nbsp; In
1838 he filled the office of High Sheriff of Norfolk, and in 1843
was appointed a deputy-lieutenant for Herefordshire.&nbsp; A
Conservative in politics, he contested the representation of
Thetford with the Earl of Euston, when a &ldquo;double
return&rdquo; resulted.&nbsp; On petition, Sir James was declared
the sitting member.&nbsp; The first baronet was an alderman of
the City of London, who filled the office of Lord Mayor in the
year of the Jubilee.</p>
<p><!-- page 485--><a name="page485"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
485</span>19.&mdash;Lieut. John Allen, commander of the Prince of
Wales Revenue cutter, boarded off Happisburgh a vessel named the
Sea Flower, of Hull, and found her laden with 122 bales of
contraband tobacco of 50 lbs. each, the duty upon which amounted
to &pound;900.&nbsp; The vessel and cargo were confiscated.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;The headquarters of the 11th Hussars arrived at
Norwich, under command of Col. the Earl of Cardigan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This regiment has a fine appearance.&nbsp; The uniform is
blue jacket, braided, scarlet trousers, and bearskin
cap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;The Queen&rsquo;s birthday was celebrated at Norwich by
the Pockthorpe &ldquo;Corporation&rdquo; parading in the Market
Place, &ldquo;the &lsquo;Mayor&rsquo; and &lsquo;Aldermen&rsquo;
wearing their scarlet gowns and bearing themselves with all the
conscious dignity of office.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Sheriff of Norwich
(Mr. James Colman) entertained the inmates of the Workhouse, the
Infirmary, and the Boys&rsquo; Home to dinner at St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, and the Mayor (Mr. Woodcock) gave a dinner
at the Assembly Rooms.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;A new organ, the gift of Col. Mason, was opened at
Necton church.</p>
<h4>JUNE.</h4>
<p>5.&mdash;An extraordinary will was left by Miss Margaret
Creake, of St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Norwich, whose death occurred on
this date.&nbsp; She was the last of three sisters, very
eccentric in their manners and parsimonious in their way of
living.&nbsp; She directed that her relatives who chose to prove
their identity should receive one shilling each; a legacy of
&pound;20 was left to one neighbour, and of &pound;10 to
another.&nbsp; She directed that &pound;50 be given to each
homeless person above 68 years of age in London, Ireland, and
Scotland, and that all her real estate be employed in founding a
hospital for aged persons, the hospital to be built and the
inmates habited according to her directions.&nbsp; The property,
valued at &pound;20,000, being insufficient, the wishes of the
testatrix could not be carried out.&nbsp; Upwards of 1,000
persons visited the late residence of the deceased, &ldquo;the
filthiness of which was beyond description.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shortly
after the death of Miss Creake, a chemist named Woolner, with
whom she had been intimate, committed suicide by poisoning
himself.&nbsp; It was then rumoured that the woman had met with
her death by foul means.&nbsp; The Coroner (Mr. Wilde) ordered
the exhumation of the body from St. Clement&rsquo;s
churchyard.&nbsp; An examination of the remains was made by Mr.
T. W. Crosse, who attributed death to natural causes.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Died at Norwich, aged 60, Mr. John Green Crosse,
senior surgeon of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.&nbsp; Mr.
Crosse was a native of Suffolk, and received his early
professional education under Mr. Bailey, at Stowmarket.&nbsp;
After a distinguished career as a medical student in London, he
became demonstrator of anatomy in Dublin.&nbsp; He visited Paris,
where he made himself sufficiently acquainted with the French
schools of medicine to enable him on his return to publish
&ldquo;Sketches of the Medical Schools of Paris.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
settled in Norwich in 1815, and in the following year married a
daughter of his former master and friend.&nbsp; In 1825 he was
elected assistant-surgeon of the Hospital, and on the death of
Mr. Bond succeeded to the surgeoncy on August 25th, 1826.&nbsp;
There he gained for himself a surgical reputation which was <!--
page 486--><a name="page486"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
486</span>described as &ldquo;not local, not provincial, not
British, not European, but universal.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Crosse was
one of the founders of the Pathological Society; he was a Fellow
of the Royal Society, a Fellow of the College of Surgeons of
England, a Doctor of Medicine in the Universities of Heidelberg
and St. Andrew&rsquo;s, a member of several scientific bodies,
and the author of many valuable professional works and
papers.&nbsp; His remains were interred on June 14th, in the
burial ground of Norwich Cathedral.</p>
<h4>JULY.</h4>
<p>9.&mdash;Intelligence was received in Norwich of the death of
H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge.&nbsp; The bells of the city
churches were tolled.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;Mrs. Charles Gill (Miss Vining) appeared at Norwich
Theatre, after an absence of five years, and was enthusiastically
received by a crowded house.</p>
<h4>AUGUST.</h4>
<p>3.&mdash;Comment was made upon the altered circumstances of
the Norwich Assize week:&mdash;&ldquo;Alterations in our system
of jurisprudence have caused some change in the character of our
Assizes, and diminished the number attending them; whilst changes
of our social system have led the higher classes to join less in
the popular amusements of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>10.&mdash;Potash Farm, formerly occupied by James Blomfield
Rush, was sold by auction by Mr. Butcher, for &pound;3,100.&nbsp;
The purchaser was Sir J. P. Boileau, Bart.</p>
<p>17.*&mdash;&ldquo;Messrs. E. and R. W. Blake, of Norwich, have
purchased the Yarn Factory, with its machinery, for
&pound;14,000, under direction of the Master in Chancery, under
the Winding-Up Act.&nbsp; The stock is valued at &pound;7,219,
making, with the purchase, the sum total of
&pound;21,219.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;Died, Hannah Sarah Hancock, daughter of the Rev. Thomas
Wigg Hancock, of St. Helen&rsquo;s parsonage, Norwich.&nbsp; She
was born on November 8th, 1781.&nbsp; At eight years of age she
compiled a dictionary for children, and throughout her life took
great interest in music and painting.&nbsp; She received the
silver medal of the Society of Arts in 1805, and in 1807 was
granted a second silver medal by the same society for an oil
painting after the design by Rubens in the altarpiece at
Antwerp.</p>
<p>&mdash;Considerable inconvenience was caused at Norwich by a
strike of the firemen and engine-drivers on the Eastern Counties
Railway.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;Died at Birkenhead, Lieut.-Col. Edwin
Cruttenden.&nbsp; Of an old Norfolk family, he was born in
1784.&nbsp; He received a commission in the Royal Artillery in
1804, was stationed ten years in the Mauritius, and in 1814 was
engaged in the capture of Oswego, North America.&nbsp; He was
appointed lieutenant-colonel in 1841.</p>
<h4><!-- page 487--><a name="page487"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 487</span>SEPTEMBER.</h4>
<p>20.&mdash;At a special meeting of the Norwich Town Council, an
address was ordered to be presented to the Bishop of Norwich on
his appointment to the diocese.&nbsp; The presentation took place
at the Palace, on October 4th.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;Died at his residence, James Street, Buckingham
Gate, London, Mr. Thomas Amyot, F.R.S., F.S.A., in his 76th
year.&nbsp; He was the eldest son of Mr. Peter Amyot, of St.
Peter Mancroft, Norwich, and was articled to Messrs. Foster and
Unthank, solicitors, of that city.&nbsp; On the accession to
power, in 1806, of the Fox and Granville parties, the Right Hon.
William Windham, Secretary for the Department of War and the
Colonies, appointed Mr. Amyot his private secretary.&nbsp; On the
dissolution of that short-lived Administration, he received a
lucrative Colonial appointment as Registrar of Slaves in the
British West India possessions, a position which he continued to
hold until his functions gradually ceased on the passing of the
Slavery Abolition Act.&nbsp; Mr. Amyot was interested in literary
pursuits and arch&aelig;ological research.&nbsp; He married Jane,
only daughter of Mr. Edward Colman, surgeon, of Norwich, by whom
he had two sons and six daughters.</p>
<h4>OCTOBER.</h4>
<p>23.&mdash;A fine schooner was launched from Mr. T.
Tyrrell&rsquo;s shipyard at Wells-next-the-Sea.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;&ldquo;The Times&rdquo; was shamefully hoaxed on
this date.&nbsp; A letter had been sent to the editor, with the
intimation that a Protectionist meeting was to be held at Lynn,
to be addressed by the Hon. E. H. Stanley, M.P., Mr.
D&rsquo;Israeli, and other gentlemen.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Times&rdquo; sent its representatives, who found that no such
meeting had been announced or even contemplated.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;Died at Blickling Hall, the Dowager Lady
Suffield.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was born in the year 1767, her early
life being passed during one of the most eventful periods, both
socially and politically, which have marked our
history.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her father was John Hobart, second Earl of
Buckinghamshire, who had been Ambassador at St. Petersburg, and
was afterwards Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.&nbsp; In 1792 she
married William Assheton, second Lord Suffield, and in 1744 her
youngest sister, Amelia Ann, was married to Lord
Castlereagh.&nbsp; &ldquo;In consequence of this union her
connection with the political world was maintained even more
intimately than before.&nbsp; Throughout her life she continued
to take a lively interest in the politics of the county, and the
influence of the united houses of Gunton and Blickling in the
days of contested elections was not lightly esteemed by
conflicting parties.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1821 she became a widow, and
thenceforth devoted herself to charitable works.&nbsp; The family
estates descended to the Marquis of Lothian, her
grand-nephew.</p>
<h4>NOVEMBER.</h4>
<p>2.&mdash;The announcement was made of the engagement of Mr.
and Mrs. F. Phillips as members of the Norwich Company, under the
<!-- page 488--><a name="page488"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
488</span>management of Mr. Joseph Clarence.&nbsp; Mrs. Phillips,
who was professionally known as Miss Ellen Daly, had acquired
Metropolitan celebrity, and &ldquo;was equally at home in serious
work, in domestic comedy, and in fashionable life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>8.&mdash;The ceremony of turning the first sod of the great
undertaking known as the Norfolk Estuary Works was performed at
Lynn by Sir William ffolkes.&nbsp; The Earl of Hardwick, the Earl
of Leicester, Mr. R. G. Tounley, M.P., and Miss Wodehouse each
deposited a spadeful of earth upon a barrow, which was wheeled
away by the Mayor.&nbsp; It was estimated that 150,000 acres of
land would be reclaimed from the sea by the completion of the
work.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Mr. Henry Woodcock was re-elected Mayor of
Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. Edward Blakely was appointed Sheriff.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;The Norwich Protestant Association held a meeting at
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, and adopted an address to the Queen
&ldquo;on the recent invasion of her Majesty&rsquo;s prerogative
by the Pope.&rdquo;&nbsp; On December 7th the clergy of the
diocese presented to the Bishop an address upon the same subject;
and on December 14th the High Sheriff (Mr. E. R. Pratt) presided
over a county meeting at the Shirehall, when resolutions
condemnatory of the action of the Pope were adopted, and an
address voted to the Queen.&nbsp; Many meetings were held in all
parts of the county, and for some weeks &ldquo;Papal
aggression&rdquo; was made a popular cry.</p>
<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>
<p>21.*&mdash;&ldquo;Baron Rolfe has been raised to the peerage,
by the dignity of Baron Cranworth, of Cranworth, in the county of
Norfolk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&mdash;Mr. J. Clarence produced a pantomime at Norwich
Theatre (title not given).&nbsp; Of the scenery and dresses it
was said, &ldquo;We never saw anything, even in the Metropolis,
more superb and more beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
